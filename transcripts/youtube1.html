P Jobs it's fine Steve Jobs is fine
00:09
president of next computer incorporated
00:14
with people that do not use quality in
00:17
their marketing are the Japanese you
00:20
never see them using quality in their
00:22
marketing it's only the American
00:24
companies that do and yet if you ask
00:26
people on the street which products have
00:28
the best reputation for quality they
00:30
will tell you the Japanese products now
00:31
why is that how could that be the answer
00:34
is because customers don't form their
00:38
opinions on quality from marketing they
00:40
don't form their opinions on quality
00:42
from who won the the Deming award or who
00:45
won the Baldrige award they form their
00:47
opinions on quality from their own
00:48
experience with the products or the
00:50
services and so one can spend enormous
00:53
amounts of money on quality one can win
00:55
every quality where there is and yet if
00:57
your products don't live up to it
01:00
customers will not keep that opinion for
01:02
long in their minds and so I think where
01:07
we have to start is with our products
01:08
and our services not with our marketing
01:10
department and we need to get back to
01:13
the basics and go improve our products
01:15
and services
01:16
now again quality isn't just the product
01:19
or the service it's having the right
01:21
product you know knowing where the
01:23
markets going and having the most
01:24
innovative products is just as much a
01:26
part of quality as the quality of the
01:29
construction of the product when you
01:30
have it and I think what we're seeing is
01:32
the quality leaders of today have
01:33
integrated that quality technology well
01:36
beyond their manufacturing now going
01:38
well into their sales and marketing and
01:40
out as far as they can to touch the
01:42
customer and trying to create super
01:45
efficient processes back from the
01:48
customer all the way through to the
01:50
delivery of the end product so if they
01:51
can have the most innovative products
01:52
understand the customer needs fastest
01:54
etc etc in most companies if you're new
02:03
and you ask you know why is it done this
02:06
way the answer is because that's the way
02:08
we do it here or because that's the way
02:09
it's always been
02:10
and in my opinion the largest
02:13
contribution of much of this quality
02:15
thinking is to approach these ways of
02:19
doing things these processes at
02:22
scientifically where there is a theory
02:25
behind why we do them there is a
02:27
description of what we do and most
02:28
importantly there is an opportunity to
02:30
always question what we do and this is a
02:33
radically different approach to business
02:36
processes than the traditional one
02:39
because it's always done this way and
02:41
that single shift is everything in my
02:46
opinion because it in that shift is a
02:49
tremendous optimistic point of view
02:52
about the people that work in a company
02:53
it says these people are very smart
02:55
they're not they're not pause they're
02:58
very smart and if given the opportunity
03:01
to change and improve they will they
03:04
will improve the processes if there's if
03:06
there's a mechanism for it and that that
03:10
optimistic humanism I find very
03:14
appealing and I think we have countless
03:16
examples that it works
