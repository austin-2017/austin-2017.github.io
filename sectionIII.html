 <div><!-- opens first paragraph -->   
Last year, the support portal team reached out to key stakeholders to better understand how to design a system that serves students in all aspects of their online studies. 
 <a href="SupportPortalInterviewSummaryDocumentFeb17.pdf">The results may be seen in this document (.pdf)</a>. Ultimately, however, the most important stakeholders are the students themselves.

Accounting for all campus departments and units relevant to these tasks resulted in a massive amount of information and diverse set of stakeholder needs.

<div><!-- opens third paragraph in introduction --> 
A traditional approach to such a task might involve compiling a comprehensive set of links, and the first design efforts reflected this strategy.

 <div><!-- opens fourth paragraph in introduction -->  		   
Initial testing revealed limitations with this approach. 
Merely aggregating existing resources meant students would need to understand the organizational hierarchy, decode jargon and recognize inconsistencies in how information was conveyed — some small and some large. 
To address this, we developed custom platform to address student questions both synchronously and asynchronously,  and archive answers. 
The platform used interactions between students and support staff to improve an artificial intelligence system developed to provide instantaneous response and generate targeted FAQs that could be browsed or searched.

Developing a mobile-friendly, accessible platform for our students with disabilities was another integral goal.

The technological component was only half of the equation that went into the development of the Online Student Support Portal. 
The other half was the commitment to the student support network, to include friends, family, and community. 
The portal takes into account those who support our students, but who may not be part of the “formal” USFSP network, such as family and friends. 
So, the technology was built to accommodate this informal network of support for the students.

<div><!-- opens seventh paragraph in introduction -->  
The functionality of the platform developed to addresses these challenges is in place. 
Launching the portal, however, requires coordination with administrators and significant user testing. 
We are convinced that the platform we have developed is unique among institutions of higher education. 
All features interact with one another, and therein lies the platform’s power. 
It was built from the ground up, right here at USFSP, with a focus on student success.
