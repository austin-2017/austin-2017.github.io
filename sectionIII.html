<p>Students have many academic and non-academic needs when attending college. If not addressed, these needs can become barriers that prevent students from completing school. Support is available; the problem for students is finding that support, and finding it in a timely manner. The sheer volume of the information is a potential source of confusion for new students, or for students who need help quickly. In the case of students with disabilities, the volume of material can be an insurmountable burden. Additional hardship cases, such as our soldiers serving overseas trying to register for an online classes, or a local student without the financial resources to afford a desktop computer, presented additional concerns. Additionally, we felt it was important to be able to include, where possible, the offline support system of family and friends for students and potential students.</p>


<p>This custom platform developed for USFSP addresses these issues. It captures questions from students, potential students, friends and family, then automatically archives them for review and ensures that they are sent on to authoritative help. Should an authority not be available to answer immediately, the system provides an automated response to the student saying that help is on the way. The platform was designed to allow anonymous questions to be asked. This permits easy access without the need to log in to an account. It also provides anonymity for students who desire it. The platform uses social media features in a way that connects students with the information they most need and, in some cases, allows them to do so anonymously. In a study exploring the value of anonymity during reference service via instant messaging (IM), the authors found that the ability to be anonymous may attract users to the IM reference service who may otherwise be uncomfortable with face-to-face references (Roper, Sobel, 2012).</p>


<p>According to Kayhan and Davis, “Privacy is fundamental to individuality, enabling us to express ourselves selectively” (Kayhan et al, 2016). Privacy was not only enabled by “where” the content was accessed, but also “how” the content was accessed. The technology of SMS messaging is built into the portal for many reasons, but in terms of the perception of privacy, it should be noted a “text” SMS message is far less likely to be overheard than a voice conversation (Hord, n.d.) and may contribute to the appeal of this medium. We also recognized students’ need to consult family and friends as a support mechanism.</p> 

<p>The platform is not meant to replace personal, one-on-one interactions between students and support staff or faculty. It simply offers a safety net to catch the students who are otherwise unable to come to campus, or are unable to avail themselves of staff during the hours that staff are available, or find themselves waiting excessive periods of time when staff is too busy to help. Research shows that, “brief computer-delivered remote interventions have several advantages over in-person interventions, including reduced cost and participant burden, greater reach, and potentially higher appeal to potential college student participants” (Rodriguez et al, 2015).</p>

<p>The platform was built very specifically to allow students — or parent, or friend, or potential student — to ask questions anonymously and privately, yet still gain access to assistance. A login is not required. In addition to promoting privacy, we found that this feature also has value to students with certain disabilities. The very process of logging in is problematic to those who rely on certain kinds of assistive technology to function. The ability to get a question answered without having to log in may seem minor to those with full motor skills, but presents a real hardship to those who do not have full use of their hands. </p>

<p>The platform employs the same technical engines that power social media, but without the algorithms that commercial social media platforms use. The platform should feel familiar and easy to use because it uses technology familiar to students. Students use social media for support (Seo et al, 2016). We had considered simply integrating off-the-shelf social media platforms into the portal, but were concerned with the problems attendant to these platforms.</p> 

<p>The problem with using the common social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter is that such companies use algorithms that aren’t designed to ferret out individual problems and get authoritative help. In fact, at one point, Facebook floated a technology devised to tinker with users’ emotions in a news feed experiment, manipulating the news feed of half a million users to change the number of “positive” and “negative” posts they saw (Goel, 2014). The bottom line: if a student needed help and reached out for it, the consequences could truly be serious if the platform’s software algorithms prevented the post from surfacing. To that end, a chat/notification system was developed in-house that reflects social media communication tools but connects students with authoritative resources. Ultimately, this system allows students to keep the support of family, friends, and in some cases, caregivers, in the loop. For more background on this, see the article, “College campus crisis: mental health services,” in the Jan. 29, 2017 Tampa Bay Times. According to the article, “Friends, family, and all things familiar are stripped away as students enter the major leagues of academic and social stress” (McNeil, 2017).</p>

<p>Additionally, and critically, the technology is context-sensitive. Authors Kaya Van Beynen and Camielle Swenson (now, Camielle Crampsie), when studying peer-to-peer and library interaction on the USFSP Facebook Page, “USFSP The Know It All's Guide To Knowing It All!,” noted “The types of reference questions between those submitted to the Know It All Guide were very different from those fielded by the NPML service desks” (Van Beynen & Swenson, 2016).</p>

<p>One facet of context is the ability to ask both general and specific questions, a capability built into the Online Student Support Portal. A general search box on the homepage connects students with answers on myriad topics. A specific search box on the “Courses” page provides results from OASIS, our online course schedule, along with special filters to customize how results are returned. Unlike the official course search page, our customized tool provides a streamlined interface that mimics the Google search experience. In other words, students can search in a way that makes intuitive sense, without needing to understand codes, catalog numbers, hierarchies, abbreviations, and other conventions internal to our systems and processes.</p>

<p>The platform was designed to be fully integrated, rather than have functionality bolted-on from third-party sources. As is true for components in the physical world, it is also true for the virtual world, where dis-similar components join, there is weakness at the joint. Relying on third-party vendors adds maintenance requirements for complicated systems; if a change is made in the vendor’s product, then everything else may be affected. Both the quality of the technology and its attendant service is uneven, and sometimes, unpredictable, with third party sources.</p>

<p>Consequently, to keep maintenance down, the platform was built as a self-integrated unit able to stand on its own. That said, this platform was designed to  integrate with the extant, or upcoming, important assets already in place at USFSP. It was extremely important to us to keep these assets in place and to connect to them — not to replace them. Student retention, a problem for all universities and colleges, was on our minds as we worked. Because the platform was developed in-house, the expertise of the platform builders aligns with students and their needs. We’re here, we live, teach, and work with the students — here, at USFSP. The platform has USFSP built into its DNA.</p>

<p>It’s important to understand that although we were tasked with providing ready access to information that “supported” online learning, we were to stop at the line that actually included online instruction. In effect, the portal would serve as a gateway to student services online. As we worked, we kept in mind the definition of “accessible” as defined by the Office of Civil Rights and the U.S. Department of Education regarding inaccessible IT — that a student with disabilities must be able to access the same information ‘’... with substantially equivalent ease of use.’’ (Note 1). Any websites and/or applications we developed had to provide information with “substantially equivalent ease of use” was a significant task. In other words, it was not enough to provide a comprehensive “website” linking to the online courses, it had to be “substantially” as easy for a person with disabilities to use as for a person without disabilities. We could not fall back on the fact that services were offered on-campus for those with disabilities. Consider the recent case of Gil v. Winn Dixie; Winn Dixie argued that only physical locations are subject to Title III of the ADA — and lost the case. The lesson as it applies to us is that, simply because student resources are available on campus, the institution still has the responsibility to make resources accessible online.</p> 

<p>The challenge was magnified by the sheer volume and diversity of the content we needed to connect: orientation, registration, advising, research and study, are examples of content and contact points we were to specifically address. Data was in silos, and we had to find a way to “flatten” it. In one trial run, we found one student with disabilities took close to thirty minutes just to access the link on OASIS simply to access the courses for his major within the upcoming semester. We felt we could do better than that for our students with disabilities. When we showed the solution to the student with disabilities, his comment was, “This is not only going to be great for students with disabilities, this is going to be great for ALL students.”</p>

<p>The reason this works for all students, and not just those with disabilities, is the fact that we do not expect students to be experts on organizational hierarchy to find the information they need. We don’t make them find the information, we bring the information to them. This is the critical, one-of-a-kind, development that we have made for our students here at USFSP.</p> 

<p>The portal was designed to align interaction with student expectations; the portal embraces a “Google” sensibility to the searches, because that is what students are comfortable using. It also embraces voice input, again, because so many students use their smartphones for performing tasks.</p> 

<p>First and last, however, the portal interface was designed to help students ask questions, and with every design stroke, to enforce the idea that we were here to listen. This is critical. Students seek help by asking questions, so the portal enables students to ask questions very easily, and at all points within it. There’s not a special “help” page. The whole portal IS a help platform. Research supports this. “The fact that explicit questions are associated with direct support seeking suggests that most of the time when people asked for direct help, they framed it in form of a question, which is not surprising.” (Andalibi et al, 2016). So, the portal interface makes it very clear that we want students — or their support network of friends and family — to feel free to ask questions. And, it starts with the landing page. Anyone can just ask.</p>

<div class="col-md-12">
<p>The very first thing a student sees when signing on to the portal is a large, “Google-Like” search box, in which he can ask anything. In this prototype version, the artificial intelligence, developed in-house here at USFSP, understands that this is a “general” question due to the context (location) of the page. There are very few tasks for the user on this page. Very few decisions have to be made at this point, and, therefore, there is very little confusion as to what is expected of the user. Modern smartphone users will be familiar with the mode of just, “asking” for what they want. However, there’s a bit of a safety net here that’s not present on most phones. If, for some reason, the student does not want to “ask” a question, “traditional” methods are available to him. The navigation bar above allows him to start a chat, or look for information on courses in particular, or generally through an information menu. The platform takes advantage of the best of both worlds, the modern convenience of mobile technology, combined with the comprehensive nature typically associated with desktop operations, and combines them into one platform.</p>

<p>In the above scenario, an automatic answer is provided by artificial intelligence (AI), coded in-house by USFSP’s Dr. Frechette. The code was developed so that the “answers” are informed by the stakeholders themselves. If a stakeholder changes the hours of operation for the department, the information immediately becomes available to the AI.</p>
