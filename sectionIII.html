Last year, the support portal team reached out to key stakeholders to better understand how to design a system that serves students in all aspects of their online studies.
The results may be found in this pdf file: <a href="SupportPortalInterviewSummaryDocumentFeb17.pdf">SupportPortalInterviewSummaryDocumentFeb17(.pdf)</a> 
Ultimately, however, the most important stakeholders of all are the students themselves.

The amount of information was massive, and the needs of the stakeholders were incredibly diverse. 
There was a need to find a way to offer the information comprehensively, with authorship by the stakeholders themselves. 
Traditionally, this was done by providing a comprehensive set of links, and the first design efforts reflected this traditional approach. 
After some initial testing, it was obvious that there was more to the problem than first met the eye. 
Students had to understand the jargon and organizational hierarchy in order to find the information they needed, and normally, they did not know either of these things when they looked for help.
Put simply, traditional web resources were not “student centric”, they were instead, “authority-centric”. 
So much time and effort is spent educating the student on “how” to find the proper authority for the proper help, that frustration is understandable. 
To address this, a custom platform using a custom process was developed in-house to address student questions, and to provide a means to archive the questions should a staff member not be around immediately to answer them. Additionally, all questions would be reviewed, not only to check for possible threats to student safety, but to continuously improve the artificial intelligence developed in-house by Dr. Frechette, as well as, to generate targeted FAQs based upon the students’ own questions. 
It also had to be mobile-friendly, and accessible to our students with disabilities.

The technological component was only half of the equation that went into the development of the Online Student Support Portal. 
The other half was the commitment to the student support network, to include friends, family, and community. 
The portal takes into account those who support our students, but who may not be part of the “formal” USFSP network, such as family and friends. 
So, the technology was built to accommodate this informal network of support for the students.
 </div><br /><!-- closes third paragraph in introduction --> 
<div><!-- opens fourth paragraph in introduction -->  
Here is the platform developed to addresses these challenges.
At this time, the functionality of the platform is in place, but it needs coordination with administrators, and significant user testing.
We are convinced that no other school has anything even remotely like this, because it is a highly integrated platform. 
The features are not piecemeal implementations; all features interact with one another, and therein lies its power. 
It was built from the ground up, right here at USFSP. 
The focus was and is about student success, and for that, we believe that this one-of-a-kind platform really and truly can significantly improve student success through the support that this platform enables.
