<span class="c5">INTRODUCTION</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Student success is at the heart of all we do&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c29 c10 c13 c19">Regional Chancellor Sophia Wisniewska</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c29 c10 c13 c19"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The USFSP Online Student Support Portal Team, consisting of Dr. Casey Frechette, Mr. Berrie Watson, and Ms. Sharon Austin, were tasked with designing a robust web presence that would allow USFSP&rsquo;s online students to accomplish all aspects of their academic careers without needing to come to campus. This included components from such significant entities as Orientation, Registration, Advising, Research and Study, among others. Everything up to, but not including, instruction was tasked; this remained under the purview of the faculty and Online Learning and Instructional Technology. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The amount of information was massive, and the needs of the stakeholders were incredibly diverse. There was a need to find a way to offer the information comprehensively, with authorship by the stakeholders themselves. Traditionally, this was done by providing a comprehensive set of links, and the first design efforts reflected this traditional approach. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After some initial testing, it was obvious that there was more to the problem than first met the eye. Students had to understand the jargon and organizational hierarchy in order to find the information they needed, and normally, they did not know either of these things when they looked for help. Put simply, traditional web resources were not &ldquo;student centric&rdquo;, they were instead, &ldquo;authority-centric&rdquo;. So much time and effort is spent educating the student on &ldquo;how&rdquo; to find the proper authority for the proper help, that frustration is understandable. To address this, a custom platform using a custom process was developed in-house to address student questions, and to provide a means to archive the questions should a staff member not be around immediately to answer them. Additionally, all questions would be reviewed, not only to check for possible threats to student safety, but to continuously improve the artificial intelligence developed in-house by Dr. Frechette, as well as, to generate targeted FAQs based upon the students&rsquo; own questions. It also had to be mobile-friendly, and accessible to our students with disabilities. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The technological component was only half of the equation that went into the development of the Online Student Support Portal. The other half was the commitment to the student support network, to include friends, family, and community. The portal takes into account those who support our students, but who may not be part of the &ldquo;formal&rdquo; USFSP network, such as family and friends. So, the technology was built to accommodate this informal network of support for the students.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here is the platform developed to addresses these challenges. At this time, the functionality of the platform is in place, but it needs coordination with administrators, and significant user testing. We are convinced that no other school has anything even remotely like this, because it is a highly integrated platform. The features are not piecemeal implementations; all features interact with one another, and therein lies its power. It was built from the ground up, right here at USFSP. The focus was and is about student success, and for that, we believe that this one-of-a-kind platform really and truly can significantly improve student success through the support that this platform enables.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c5">BACKGROUND</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">Last year, the support portal team reached out to key stakeholders to better understand how to design a system that serves students in all aspects of their online studies. The results may be found here: </span><span class="c10 c51"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dspace.nelson.usf.edu/xmlui/handle/10806/14940&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1499781808698000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZ_RgRqOu2mDC2aV21-_f1p4QZCw">http://dspace.nelson.usf.edu/xmlui/handle/10806/14940</a></span><span class="c1">. Ultimately, however, the most important stakeholders of all are the students themselves. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Students have many needs when attending college, and not just academic ones. These additional needs, if not addressed, may turn into barriers that prevent students from completing school. Support is available; the problem for students is finding that support, and finding it in a timely manner. The sheer volume of the information is </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">problematic, and a potential point of confusion to new students, or to students who needed help quickly. In the case of students with disabilities, the sheer volume of material to go through can be an insurmountable burden. Additional hardship cases, such as our soldiers serving overseas trying to register for an online classes, or a local student without the financial resources to afford a desktop computer, presented additional concerns. Additionally, we felt it was important to be able to include, where possible, the support system of family and friends for students and potential students. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This custom platform developed for USFSP addresses the issues above. It captures questions from students, potential students, friends and family, then automatically archives them for review, and ensures that they are sent on to authoritative help. Should an authority not be available to answer immediately, the system provides an automated response to the student saying that help is on the way. The platform was designed to allow anonymous questions to be asked, in order to address the students who are unwilling to ask a question for fear of looking ignorant. The technology that powers social media is used in the platform, but does so without the problematic algorithms used in the social media platforms commonly used. Privacy and anonymity are available to students, should they want it or need it. In a study exploring the value of anonymity during reference service via instant messaging (IM), the authors found that the ability to be anonymous may attract users to the IM reference service who may otherwise be uncomfortable with face-to-face references (Roper, Sobel, 2012). </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">According to Kayhan and Davis, &ldquo;Privacy is fundamental to individuality, enabling us to express ourselves selectively&rdquo; (Kayhan et al, 2016). Privacy was not only enabled by &ldquo;where&rdquo; the content was accessed, but also &ldquo;how&rdquo; the content was accessed. The technology of SMS messaging is built into the portal for many reasons, but in terms of the </span><span class="c10 c13">perception of privacy</span><span class="c1">, it should be noted a &ldquo;text&rdquo; SMS message is far less likely to be overheard than a voice conversation, (Hord, n.d.) and may in fact be a reason that text messaging lends itself to many. We also recognized students&rsquo; need to consult family and friends as a support mechanism. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The platform is not meant to replace personal, one-on-one interactions between students and support staff, or faculty. It simply offers a safety net to catch the students who are otherwise unable to come to campus, or are unable to avail themselves of staff during the hours that staff are available, or find themselves waiting excessive periods of time when staff is too busy to help. Research shows that, &ldquo;brief computer-delivered remote interventions have several advantages over in-person interventions, including reduced cost and participant burden, greater reach, and potentially higher appeal to potential college student participants&rdquo; (Rodriguez et al, 2015).</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The platform was built very specifically to allow students -- or parent, or friend, or potential student -- to ask questions anonymously and privately, yet still gain access to assistance. A login is not required. In addition to promoting privacy, we found that this feature also has value to students with certain disabilities. The very process of logging in is problematic to those who rely on certain kinds of assistive technology to function. The ability to get a question answered without having to log in may seem minor to those with full motor skills, but presents a real hardship to those who do not have full use of their hands. </span></p><p class="c14 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The platform employs the same technical engines that power social media, but without the algorithms that commercial social media platforms use. The platform should feel familiar and easy to use because it uses technology familiar to students. Students use social media for support (Seo et al, 2016). We had considered simply integrating off-the-shelf social media platforms into the portal, but were concerned with the problems attendant to these platforms. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The problem with using the common social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter is that such companies use algorithms that aren&rsquo;t designed to ferret out individual problems and get authoritative help. In fact, at one point, Facebook floated a technology devised to tinker with users&rsquo; emotions in a news feed experiment, manipulating the news feed of half a million users to change the number of &ldquo;positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;negative&rdquo; posts they saw (Goel, 2014). The bottom line: if a student needed help and reached out for it, the consequences could truly be serious if the platform&rsquo;s software algorithms prevented the post from surfacing. To that end, a chat/notification system was developed in-house that uses the social media technology, but is anchored by authoritative staff. Ultimately, this system allows students to keep the support of family, friends, and in some cases, caregivers, in the loop. For more background on this, see the article, &ldquo;College campus crisis: mental health services&rdquo;, in the Sunday, January 29, 2017 Tampa Bay Times. According to the article, &ldquo;Friends, family, and all things familiar are stripped away as students enter the major leagues of academic and social stress&rdquo; (McNeil, 2017). </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">Additionally, and critically, the technology is context-sensitive. Authors Kaya Van Beynen and Camielle Swenson (now, Camielle Crampsie), when studying peer-to-peer and library interaction on the USFSP Facebook Page, &ldquo;</span><span class="c1">USFSP The Know It All&#39;s Guide To Knowing It All!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&rdquo;, noted &ldquo;The types of reference questions between those submitted to the Know It All Guide were very different from those fielded by the NPML service desks&rdquo; (Van Beynen, Swenson, 2016). The Online Student Support Portal interacts on a context-sensitive basis. If a student is on the &ldquo;Courses&rdquo; page, then asking a question on that page will bring up answers that relate to courses. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The platform was designed to be a fully integrated one, rather than have functionality bolted-on from third-party sources. As is true for components in the physical world, it is also true for the virtual world, where dis-similar components join, there is weakness at the joint. Relying on third-party vendors adds maintenance requirements for complicated systems; if a change is made in the vendor&rsquo;s product, then everything else may be affected. Both the quality of the technology and its attendant service is uneven, and sometimes, unpredictable, with third party sources. Consequently, in order to keep maintenance down, the platform was built as a self-integrated unit capable of standing on its own. That said, this platform was designed in mind specifically to be capable of integration with the extant, or upcoming, important assets already in place at USFSP. It was extremely important to us to keep these assets in place and to connect to them -- not to replace them. Student retention was on our minds as we worked; student retention is a problem for all universities and colleges. The fact that the platform was developed in-house aligns the expertise of the platform builders with the students, and their needs. We&rsquo;re here, we live, teach, and work with the students -- here, at USFSP. The platform has USFSP built into its DNA.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">It&rsquo;s important to understand that although we were tasked with providing ready access to information that &ldquo;supported&rdquo; online learning, we were to stop at the line that actually included online instruction. In effect, the portal would serve as a gateway to student services online. As we worked, we kept in mind the definition of &ldquo;accessible&rdquo; as defined by the Office of Civil Rights and the U.S. Department of Education regarding inaccessible IT -- that a student with disabilities must be able to access the same information &lsquo;&rsquo;...</span><span class="c10 c13">&nbsp;with substantially equivalent ease of use.&rsquo;&rsquo; </span><span class="c10">(Note 1). Any websites and/or applications we developed had to provide information with &ldquo;</span><span class="c10 c13">substantially equivalent ease of use</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;, was a significant task. In other words, it was not enough to provide a comprehensive &ldquo;website&rdquo; linking to the online courses, it had to be &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; as easy for a person with disabilities to use, as for a person without disabilities. We could not fall back on the fact that services were offered on-campus for those with disabilities. Consider the recent case of Gil v. Winn Dixie; Winn Dixie argued that only physical locations are subject to Title III of the ADA -- and lost the case. The lesson as it applies to us is that, simply because student resources are available on campus, does not relieve the institution responsibility of making resources accessible online. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The challenge was magnified by the sheer volume and diversity of the content we needed to connect: orientation, registration, advising, research and study, are examples of content and contact points we were to specifically address. Data was in silos, and we had to find a way to &ldquo;flatten&rdquo; it. In one trial run, we found one student with disabilities took close to thirty minutes just to access the link on OASIS simply to access the courses for his major within the upcoming semester. We felt we could do better than that for our students with disabilities. When we showed the solution to the student with disabilities, his comment was, &ldquo;This is not only going to be great for students with disabilities, this is going to be great for ALL students&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The reason this works for all students, and not just those with disabilities, is the fact that we do not expect students to be experts on organizational hierarchy to find the information they need. We don&rsquo;t make them find the information, we bring the information to them. This is the critical, one-of-a-kind, development that we have made for our students here at USFSP. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The portal was designed to align interaction with student expectations; the portal embraces a &ldquo;Google&rdquo; sensibility to the searches, because that is what students are comfortable using. It also embraces voice input, again, because so many students use their smartphones for performing tasks. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">First and last, however, the portal interface was designed to specifically ASK questions, and with every design stroke, to enforce the idea that we were here to listen. This is critical. Students seek help by asking questions, so the portal enables students to ask questions very easily, and at all points within it. There&rsquo;s not a special &ldquo;help&rdquo; page. The whole portal IS a help platform. Research supports this. &ldquo;The fact that explicit questions are associated with direct support seeking suggests that most of the time when people asked for direct help, they framed it in form of a question, which is not surprising.&rdquo; (Andalibi et al, 2016). So, the portal interface makes it very clear that we want students -- or their support network of friends and family -- to feel free to ask questions. And, it starts with the landing page. Anyone can just ask.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 313.33px;"><img alt="JustAsk.jpg" src="images/image80.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 313.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c8">[ III - I ] Figure 1. A screenshot of the landing page. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">The very first thing a student sees when signing on to the portal is a large, &ldquo;Google-Like&rdquo; search box, in which he can ask anything. In this prototype version, the artificial intelligence, developed in-house here at USFSP, understands that this is a &ldquo;general&rdquo; question due to the context (location) of the page. The point is, that there are very few tasks for the user on this page. Very few decisions have to be made at this point, and therefore, </span><span class="c7">very little confusion as to what is expected of the user. Modern smartphone users will be familiar with the mode of just, &ldquo;asking&rdquo; for what they want. However, there&rsquo;s a bit of a safety net here that&rsquo;s not present on most phones. If, for some reason, the student does not want to &ldquo;ask&rdquo; a question, &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; methods are available to him. The navigation bar above allows him to start a chat, or look for information on courses in particular, or generally through an information menu. The platform takes advantage of the best of both worlds, the modern convenience of mobile technology, combined with the comprehensive nature typically associated with desktop operations, and combines them into one platform.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c16">In the above scenario, an automatic answer is provided by artificial intelligence (AI), coded in-house by USFSP&rsquo;s Dr. Frechette. The code was developed so that the &ldquo;answers&rdquo; are informed by the stakeholders themselves. If a stakeholder changes the hours of operation for the department, then the information is placed into a database which immediately becomes available for the AI to use. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c5">HOW THE PORTAL WAS BUILT</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c15 c10"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c15 c10"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c15 c10">The architecture of the Online Student Support Portal was designed and developed by Dr. Casey Frechette. He created the code libraries and blueprints by which to construct the custom Content Management System (CMS). This meant, specifically, that he designed the custom, responsive Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) as well as the custom database structure to provide customized data output. Mr. Berrie Watson designed and established the network architecture by which the portal was able to be developed in a manner that ensured stability, and also, safety for the network. Without this solid foundation of the database maintenance and perimeter fence of network security, none of us would have been able to work. Ms. Sharon Austin &ldquo;built&rdquo; the CMS according to the code blueprints and libraries designed and developed by Dr. Casey Frechette. Because of the team&rsquo;s commitment to accessibility, a USFSP student with multiple disabilities, Mr. Robert Beasey, was present while the CMS was built, to provide input on at least a weekly basis.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c15 c10"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c15 c10"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c15">Development of the portal was iterative, with multiple files being updated simultaneously and replicated using SourceTree and GIT. Protection of the work and access for varying levels of network visibility required for the project. The control of data into and out of secure networks at the USFSP Nelson Poynter Memorial Library involved use of VPN, Cisco firewall, and local controls to establish access for onsite users only during the development period. Virtual networks allowed the machine exposure to either a live, unrestricted network, or an internal/VPN network when necessary. The architecture of the server used was virtual, based on VMWare products. Two instances were employed, for testing and pre-production. Testing and development were done using a combination of local MAMP environments and a testing instance on a stand-alone machine using VMWare Workstation. A production level instance was copied from the testing virtual machine and located on a VMWare ESX host and storage array. Backups and systems components were managed in a flexible manner virtually, which allowed &lsquo;snapshots&rsquo; of machine state and data at critical times. This allowed rollbacks to prior server and data states, protecting programming milestones and lessening the risks of testing. Virtual backups were stored off-array using Dell&rsquo;s vRanger Pro application to compress and manage backups of the full server.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c29 c40">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c29 c10 c43 c66"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c15 c10">While the paragraph above describes the technical aspects of the construction of the portal, it does not address the commitment to a &lsquo;student-first&rsquo; vision. The team recognized that technology alone could not solve the problems stakeholders identified in the interviews. The technology had to connect students with the support they needed in a meaningful way, and for the process to be meaningful, all parties had to be able to participate. A barrier to participation is the fact that information and expertise is in silos. Another barrier to participation is the fact that often, a student must have a log in and/or NetID to get help. This precludes family, friends, and community members that could help the student from participating easily in assisting the student. &ldquo;Bureaucratic and hierarchical organizations show formal and administrative procedures that prevent the sharing of knowledge and new ideas&rdquo; (Khosrow-Pour, 2008). In examining the organizational charts, we found that it was almost inevitable that information the student needed would fall into silos. Single or few authoritative experts held the keys to the knowledge kingdom. Yet, we all understand, instinctively, that it does indeed take a village to raise a child. &ldquo;A community of individuals is more likely to practice wisdom than a single individual.&rdquo; (Gunawardena et al, 2004). </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c15 c10"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10 c16">Consequently, the &ldquo;vision&rdquo; of how to solve the technical problem on how break through information silos, and connect a community of support to the student in need, was based on over a decade&rsquo;s worth of thought and consideration. The vision of how to use technology to solve a human problem was built upon a FOCAL model. &ldquo;The mission of the FOCAL model is to provide support for an online community through human-human interaction. Learning is a participatory process where members share their feeling of belonging, experiences, ritual, culture, and knowledge in a collaborative practice in support of the community&#39;s common goals and missions.&rdquo; (Gunawardena et al, 2004). The vision of using a FOCAL model to use technology to solve the problems identified by stakeholders dovetailed with the Regional Chancellor&rsquo;s Bold Goals of Strategic Partnerships. The portal is designed to allow communications with, and share resources with, USFSP Partners that provide civic engagement and off-campus mentoring. </span><span class="c15 c10">It&rsquo;s important to note, however, that control is granular on the platform. There&rsquo;s an ability for organizational units to use the platform as an internal communication system to communicate information about student questions. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c10 c15"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10 c16">The technology of the portal was designed and developed to cross silos, and to surface diverse expertise to the student, rather than have the student look for the expertise. This meant that the portal had to be able to put everything from all the various departments into just one bucket, and then sort it out again when the student asked for it. In order to make sure that this could happen, functionality testing was done frequently, and iteratively.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c15 c10"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c15 c10"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c15 c10"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c15 c10"></span></p><p class="c14 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c14 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c5">OVERVIEW OF CRITICAL CONCERNS</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.zbqfdgyj69rh"><span class="c5">1.

No middle-man is required.</span></h5><p class="c12"><span class="c26">To address confusion: </span><span class="c7">The portal was designed to bridge the &ldquo;two kinds&rdquo; of content silos: Technological, and Organizational. The portal provides a technological path to cross silos, but the technology alone is not enough. Organizational expertise is made available via keywords so that student concerns may be forwarded to an appropriate organizational unit by consulting a keyword list. This enables a bridge across silos not only from a technical standpoint, but an informational one also. It enables a way to find the expertise of other departments. The keywords are maintained by the stakeholders themselves.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7 c18"></span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.xivscdbe0gos"><span class="c5">2.

The myth of the Digital Native assumes that students are able to find help easily on digital platforms, because they have been using them most of their lives. While it is true that students are familiar with these platforms, they are not necessarily familiar with how to search for help using them. Students rely heavily on Google, but they are not very good at customizing searches to get targeted results. The portal takes advantage of an interface that is Google-like in function, in order to make the student feel comfortable.

This was accomplished via custom code, developed in-house, and unique to USFSP. </span></h5><h5 class="c9" id="h.s008tcx7g542"><span class="c10 c13 c19 c26">To address confusion:</span><span class="c29 c10 c13 c19">&nbsp;First of two initiatives to address confusion -- The portal structure was developed to work around centralized repositories, customized to USFSP and populated by authoritative USFSP stakeholders. This content is dynamically generated, meaning, as soon as a stakeholder updates the information, the information is immediately available to students. No middle-man is required.</span></h5><p class="c12"><span class="c13 c26">To address confusion: </span><span class="c29 c13 c19">Second of two initiatives to address confusion -- The portal was designed to bridge the &ldquo;two kinds&rdquo; of content silos: Technological, and Organizational. The portal provides a technological path to cross silos, but the technology alone is not enough. Organizational expertise is made available via keywords so that student concerns may be forwarded to an appropriate organizational unit by consulting a keyword list. This enables a bridge across silos not only from a technical standpoint, but an informational one also. It enables a way to find the expertise of other departments. The keywords are maintained by the stakeholders themselves.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c37 c26">More information on portal initiatives to address this item:</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">Students find it difficult to obtain information, so to address this difficulty, the portal was designed to bring information to the student, rather than have the student look for the information. The information that is delivered via this interface is designed to be specifically relevant to USFSP, delivering a better and more targeted result than an student would be able to retrieve via a Google search. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>The problem is, of course, how to &ldquo;categorize&rdquo; information, both in terms of how questions are phrased, and where to get the answers to the question. In other words, the right answer has to be given to the right question, and sometimes, even the author of the question themselves to not know how to word a question. Librarians are extraordinarily trained in this subject matter -- or, perhaps it would be better to say, subject matters. The first subject matter is, what question is really being asked? The second subject matter is, where is the appropriate information to answer the question? Early research by USFSP&rsquo;s very own Tina Neville and Deb Henry noted the following: </span><span class="c7">&lsquo;Online resources and new technologies have altered the types of questions received at library reference desks, leading some institutions to reconsider the classification systems used to document reference service.&rdquo;(Neville et al, 2009).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">None of us can be expert at all subject matters, and few of us may afford the training that librarians receive in order to classify information. No software can compete. But with the platform, we CAN cut a path to the librarians and their expertise, or, for that matter, the expertise of any other expert on campus -- and the platform can provide a roadmap to make this happen. The roadmap is provided by the stakeholders themselves, in the form of keywords. Also, the portal is set up so that staff from different departments may both be alerted to help the student with a question. In other words, the platform crosses institutional silos. As we were interviewing stakeholders, one of the example questions posed to us was, &ldquo;What if a student asks to do research on a business problem? Does the question go to the Research Department, or to the Business School?&rdquo; Our answer is, &ldquo;both&rdquo;. On our platform, a question on business research goes to both the Reference Librarians and to the Business School. This is the &ldquo;technical&rdquo; bridge. The &ldquo;cognitive bridge&rdquo; across silos is addressed by the keyword list as mentioned before, but also, by context. If a student is on the &ldquo;Courses&rdquo; page, the words used in a student question would take on a different meaning than they would if he were on a chat page. And, for that reason, would search a different (unique-to-USFSP) set of data.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>It&rsquo;s important to note that, even though students may be able to come to campus and obtain help to do this, there are times they prefer not to, and instead, choose to use automated systems -- </span><span class="c13">even when they are on campus</span><span class="c7">. In a report on the assessment of the use of Self-Checkout Machines at Nelson Poynter Memorial Library, the authors found that some of the reasons patrons did not ask for help were that they were too embarrassed to ask for assistance (15%) or that the library staff had been too busy or unable to help (15%) (van Beynen et al, 2013). It&rsquo;s probably safe to say that all departments have experienced times in which staff were so busy, that they were unable to attend to students immediately. It is for this reason that online resources are so valuable, even for students who are able to come to campus. For those who are totally unable to come to campus, such as our soldier-students serving overseas, the feature is priceless.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>This portal was built in-house to deliver content relevant to USFSP, rather than all of the USF system. Because it was built in-house, by USFSP employees, the portal has the knowledge of USFSP resources built into its DNA. This feature helps all USFSP students, but it has particular application to our students with disabilities, in that it greatly facilitates a disabled student&rsquo;s abilities to find information with a substantially equivalent ease of use as a student without disabilities. This is important; there is legislation that addresses accessibility as it applies to the ease of use obtaining information. (</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;&ldquo;Accessible&rdquo; as defined by the Office of Civil Rights and the U.S. Department of Education regarding inaccessible IT -- that a student with disabilities must be able to access the same information &lsquo;&rsquo;...</span><span class="c10 c13">&nbsp;with substantially equivalent ease of use.&rsquo;&rsquo; </span><span class="c10">(Note 1).

By both visual design, and by functionality, the portal positions itself to </span><span class="c10 c13">listen</span><span class="c1">.

The process of bringing information to students rather than have students go after the information also &ldquo;modernizes&rdquo; the information delivery tool, dovetailing the process with the modern expectations students have about &ldquo;how&rdquo; they get their information; students have long expected that digital communication paths will be used to communicate with them (Kvavik, 2005). </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>Mental effort varies across task stages (</span><span class="c10">Gwizdka, J. 2010)</span><span class="c7">. Links and buttons on a website may seem to be simple choices to those familiar with organizational hierarchy, but present multiple cognitive task stages to those unfamiliar with the organization. For example, a new student, when presented with choices on a web page, would first need to decipher the meaning of the jargon on a link or button, and then make a decision as to whether or not the button or link will actually lead him to the information he seeks. Typically, a solution is to provide helpful resources, such as FAQ pages or videos which, in essence, &ldquo;train&rdquo; the user to understand the hierarchy or jargon used. This is extremely time-consuming, and in the case of those students who only have low-bandwidth available to them, or who have disabilities, these time-consuming self-help resources can actually serve as a kind of barrier to getting the information. What we tried to do with this platform is to find a way to &ldquo;train&rdquo; the platform to the student, rather than train a student to the platform.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">To avoid expecting a student to know organizational hierarchy, or understand specific jargon associated with departments, programs, or specific services, an interaction built on custom data tables, populated by stakeholders, was paired with custom code that captured the individual student question, analyzed it, and provide an answer, or alternative ways to get the answer. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">This may be broken down into two components, each from different sources. The first component is the data the student seeks. It must be authoritative, and current. The second component is the manner in which the student asks for the data. He may or may not use the correct term for the information he seeks. He may or may not ask for it in a format that mirrors common speech patterns. The issue becomes even more complicated when search queries use voice as the format for input. The software must &ldquo;understand&rdquo; speech through a what may prove to be imperfect formation of the words. Brice notes that speech perception, &ldquo;..must interpret the sound and identify the sound (speech perception). Speech perception is more than just hearing sounds&rdquo; (Brice, 2014).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">In the case of students with disabilities, they may use a specialized form of search that is meant to cast a wide net of options that he may then narrow down to a reasonable &ldquo;guess&rdquo; of the appropriate jargon or terminology, and proceed from that narrowed-down list. But, it is an extremely slow process when one has poor motor skills, poor mobility, poor vision, or all of the above. It is because of the fact that a student with multiple disabilities was included at all stages of the design of the portal that it was designed with the intent to bring content to the student, rather than the other way around. In that regard, we do feel that the portal platform addresses accessibility as a strategy, rather than a tactic.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">That said, simply because the appropriate information becomes available to the student, does not mean the student may necessarily receive the right help in a timely manner. This is because information is in silos. The content is in silos, and also, the knowledge of who owns the content is in silos.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">To address this problem, a keyword index was created as an integral part of the portal. It dynamically generates the index on keywords created by, and maintained by, the stakeholders.

Muilenburg and Berge noted eight student barriers to online learning, among them, administrative issues. (Muilenburg, Berge 2007). Forms are central to the administrative process; locating forms is troublesome, even for staff. It is even more difficult for students, who are unfamiliar with jargon or organizational hierarchy. In the interviews, one stakeholder recommended that &ldquo;...the development of a single repository for forms could be extremely valuable campus wide.&rdquo; (See page 62 of the report: Support Services for Online Learners at USFSP for full context)</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Consequently, such a repository was created, to be dynamically generated by content entered by the stakeholders themselves.

At a minimum, one level of privacy is enabled by simply providing a method by which a student -- or parent, or friend -- may ask a question without a requirement to provide personal information. The question could be routed to an appropriate authority. The question itself, however, would be captured for evaluation and subsequent filtering for possible referral, and/or to inform the FAQ resource. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">The &ldquo;technology&rdquo; used in social media was used to develop this component of the platform. Although this platform is a technological &ldquo;cousin&rdquo; to such social platforms as Facebook and Twitter, it has a distinct, important difference -- there is no algorithm in place that would keep important questions from surfacing, as in the case of Facebook. All questions are seen, and all are reviewed; none get buried. Where they cannot be answered right away, notifications are sent to appropriate, authoritative parties or offices. This matters. According to Beetham, students want more guidance on academically credible sources and academically legitimate uses of online content (Beetham White, et al, 2013). The question is retained, and a status assigned, so that stakeholders may review the status of the questions to prioritize those which have not been addressed yet. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">While it may be counter-intuitive, one of the portal features meant to address student safety is the anonymous feature of chat. &ldquo; In an examination of Reddit posts about experiences of sexual abuse, Andalibi, Haimson, De Choudhury, and Forte (2016) found that posts that described a need to self-disclose, in addition to posts that explicitly included reasons for disclosing or not disclosing, were more likely to be posted from a &ldquo;throwaway&rdquo; account, or a temporary account created to dissociate content from a user&rsquo;s primary Reddit identity&rdquo; (Andalibi et al, 2016)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c1">A special feature for student safety was implemented based on the recommendation of one our students with disabilities. During one of the feedback sessions we had with him, he recommended a geolocation feature be incorporated into the portal so that, in an emergency, if he were unable to call for assistance, then his phone could be used for geolocation by first responders. A screenshot of the incorporation of the technology may be seen below. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 206.67px;"><img alt="PortalGeolocation.jpg" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 206.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h4 class="c4" id="h.f5vjd5lhoreg"><span class="c8">[Section VII - 2] Geolocation: Figure 1. </span></h4><p class="c12"><span>The image above is a screenshot of a geolocation request made from the portal platform.

As mentioned, this was done on the behest of one of our students with disabilities, but we believe it could have broader applications. According to an article on Education Drive, &ldquo;</span><span class="c68">Campus police are praising some of the apps for creating a new trove of incident alerts and detailed tips, complete with GPS coordinates, detailed physical descriptions, and photos of potential lawbreakers or license plates. And, they say, the new apps seem to be catching on partly because students feel more comfortable with texting or communicating through the apps instead of calling, which may be an intimidating task.</span><span>&rdquo; (Button, 2014). The problem, of course, is getting students to download an app. The portal technology above does not require the download of an app; it is built on the latest web technology.

While it is true that students are familiar with these platforms, they are not necessarily familiar with how to search for help using them. Students rely heavily on Google, but they are not very good at customizing searches to get targeted results. The portal takes advantage of an interface that is Google-like in function, in order to make the student feel comfortable. Under the hood, however, the database is built to deliver targeted resources for students to get to the help they need. This is done first, through a Google-like search, then via chat, or email. From there, authoritative resources can connect with the student, directing him to the appropriate resources, for example, the Student Success Center or the Student Technology Center.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c13 c19"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c37 c26">More information on portal initiatives to address this item:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c29 c13 c37">Connect students to help in a more robust manner and targeted manner, technologically.</span></p><h5 class="c9" id="h.qybqm1v9sz7"><span class="c1">As mentioned earlier, many students approach online learning with misconceptions about the rigor required of the experience.

Further, the questions are archived, and if found to be a common question, or an important one, are converted to an additional resource as an FAQ. An additional point is that this process serves as a resource not only for the students, but for the staff who support them.

As we started to investigate &ldquo;how&rdquo; students interact with screens for the Online Student Support Portal, we realized we may have been operating on some presumptions.</span></p><h5 class="c9" id="h.ulbpt02ps9zf"><span class="c10 c19">According to an article in the Policy and Publications section of the ECDL (European Computer Driving Licence) website, &ldquo;This idea of digital natives is a dangerous fallacy that risks leaving young people without the competences they need for the workplace, and risks leaving businesses without the skilled employees they need.&rdquo; (ECDL, n.d.). While millennials may have had access to digital platforms from birth, &ldquo;access doesn&rsquo;t automatically equal competency&rdquo; (Glazer, 2016). We soon realized that perhaps, we expected that the students would actually learn how to search on campus. But in an article from the Chronicle of Higher Education, &ldquo;Confronting the Myth of the Digital Native&rdquo;, the author found that, &ldquo;</span><span class="c10 c17">Campus efforts to educate students about their digital presence, if they happen at all, exist as one-off, library-sponsored workshops or course addenda. They usually emphasize enhanced privacy settings on social-media accounts and scary case studies of career-ending YouTube videos.&rdquo; (O&rsquo;Neil, 2014).</span></h5><p class="c12"><span>Put in plain English: When students need help, they go to Google. They may not know how to search to get the answers they need in seeking academic help. So, a Google-like Search feature was built, to look and act like Google, but under the hood the code was directing students to the help they needed.</span></p><h5 class="c9" id="h.fho80tic6c7"><span class="c10 c60">Students </span><span class="c10 c13 c41">do</span><span class="c10 c60">&nbsp;use library databases &ndash; though they often start in Google. </span><span class="c10">Regardless of the advanced-search capabilities of the database they were querying, &ldquo;Students generally treated all search boxes as the equivalent of a Google search box, and searched &lsquo;Google-style,&rsquo; using the &lsquo;any word anywhere&rsquo; keyword as a default,&rdquo; they wrote. Out of the 30 students Duke and Asher observed doing research, 27 failed to narrow their search criteria at all when doing so would have turned up more helpful returns.</span></h5><p class="c12"><span class="c7">Once students start using the portal&rsquo;s Google-like search utility, they either are directed to the information they need, or if the answer proves to be unsatisfactory, are offered a place to browse for answers or start a chat. The point is, that we address the myth of the Digital Native by removing the intimidation factor as much as possible; we do that by making it look and feel as much like Google as is possible. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c48 c43"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c16">In higher education, access to libraries -- and more importantly, librarians, is critical.

However, there are some additional features developed specifically for this Online Student Support Portal that has particular relevance to collaboration.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">First: The chat provides a keyword list so a staff member, unfamiliar with the detailed list of which librarian answers which question, is able to route the question to the appropriate librarian, or group of librarians. Many chat technologies embody a technology that enables one staff member to forward a question to another staff member. This is a technological bridge. However, the technology alone is not enough. A &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; to connect the different kinds of expertise, by concept, is also needed. This is where the keyword index comes in. It allows staff members who are not expert in an area look up keywords to find the right expert. This is &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; feature to the portal that is not available on commercial, off-the-shelf chat technologies.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">Second: Targeted, context-sensitive chat widgets. The chat widget will programmatically understand by the context of the page that it is on that a student is seeking help on a library question. The librarian will receive the question. In other words, it is context-sensitive. This is another &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; feature on the portal that helps bring the right librarian the right question. Taking the example of the Library Guides for Nelson Poynter Memorial Library, we could illustrate context-sensitivity.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">As an example, a &ldquo;context-sensitive&rdquo; chat widget could be embedded on this page for the Liaison Librarian, Gary Austin. The context in this particular case would be for the Subject Specialties that concern Business.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 333.33px;"><img alt="GaryAustinLibGuide.jpg" src="images/image33.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 333.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h5 class="c4" id="h.tqibays60u7x"><span class="c10 c19 c26">[ VII - 3 ] Example of a Recommended Context-Specific Location for Chat: Figure 1.</span></h5><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>Gary Austin would be able to install a chat widget on this page, or any other page that he would be responsible for, as a librarian. The chat widget would be able to show specifically whether Gary Austin is available for chat. This, in turn, would depend upon the hours set for his individual chat widget on his profile page. Individual, context-sensitive chat widgets are available through the Online Student Support Platform; if such widgets were embedded in pages such as the one above, it would </span><span class="c21">create a more obvious presence that help is available. (The request to create a more obvious presence that help is available was a comment from a student from one of the Library focus groups held in the first part of 2017). In the screen shots below, we show how that would be done in the Online Student Support Portal.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 314.67px;"><img alt="ChatWidgetProfile.jpg" src="images/image35.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 314.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h5 class="c4" id="h.w5rv5ftcymrf"><span class="c8">[ VII - 3 ] Individual Chat Availability: Figure 1.</span></h5><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>In the screenshot above, we see that Gary Austin has not yet set his personal chat to show availability. He is able to set chat </span><span class="c13">hours</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;of availability, however, without making the chat itself available. This is so that he may set hours in advance. Once he checks the &ldquo;My Availability&rdquo; checkbox, the chat widget, that we may assume could be embedded on the specific LibGuide page for which he is responsible, would signal that he is available for chat. The hours set would be unique to him, and not to any other librarian. We&rsquo;re using the library as an example, but this chat capability would be available to all departments at USFSP, for example, the Journalism Department.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>There&rsquo;s an additional, important point to be made: tracking by context is enabled. In other words, the architecture of the portal is set up to see &ldquo;which&rdquo; chat widgets on &ldquo;which&rdquo; pages are being used, and when. It also has the capability to track which device is being used to access the particular chat widget, and during which hours. The question itself is not tracked. There is no association between the question asked, and the technology by which the question is asked, in order to preserve student privacy. But the analytic information available from such tracking on the context-sensitive, personalized widgets is absolutely invaluable. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c48 c43"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c11">Regarding Information Literacy: </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c27 c21 c19"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c21">Students simply need to be able to connect with help. The library already embraces five different methods of connecting with students; chat, email, phone, appointment, and walk-in. The portal allows this to happen campus-wide, and to connect students to diverse groups that may share answers. For example when a student asks the question, &ldquo;How do I do research for my business courses&rdquo; , the answer, as it has been conceived for this portal, is to route the question to BOTH Gary Austin (The Library Liaison for the Business College ) and an authorized person at the Kate Tiedemann College of Business. Right now, delivery of content is in silos. If a department has a chat feature, the chat question does not cross departmental boundaries. The Online Student Support Portal, envisioned to be a fully integrated system, addresses this problem. As mentioned earlier, </span><span>if such widgets were embedded in pages more broadly on campus, it would </span><span class="c21">create a more obvious presence that help is available to the student. This matters to the student, and would help enforce the concept that the university is committed to student success.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c27 c21 c48"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c11">Regarding Marketing:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c27 c21 c19"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c27 c21 c19">One comment from a student was that they did not know how to use a chat with a librarian. This is understandable, as chat technology is not commonly used across campus. Right now, only a few departments on campus, such as Nelson Poynter Memorial Library and the Journalism department, use chat. If the chat widgets were used across the board, then they would gain familiarity with students. Part of the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know how&rdquo; is simply, that students are unfamiliar with it. Embedding chat widgets everywhere, instead of on only a handful of locations, should help create a more obvious presence that help is available. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c27 c21 c19"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c21">The important point to remember is, that it is not simply the fact of embedding &ldquo;a lot&rdquo; of chat widgets, everywhere, that will help, although we do believe that is very valuable in its own right. By embedding chat widgets broadly, we ease the burden placed on the student in the position of finding the &ldquo;special&rdquo; places that only the chat widgets may be found. We certainly support the broad implementation of chat widgets! That said, we believe that it is by embedding </span><span class="c13 c21">context-sensitive</span><span class="c27 c21 c19">&nbsp;chat widgets, that tie to targeted offices of support, that will make an even greater difference. The very presence of a particular chat widget on a particular page already &ldquo;helps&rdquo; the student in asking a question, because the support person on the other side of the chat will understand that the context of the question came from a particular page. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c27 c21 c19"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c27 c21 c19"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.h9is4hdk9bxn"><span class="c5">4.

There are many great initiatives already in place at USFSP; all are certainly to be applauded for their success. Here, we address a contribution that may be made to the success of integrating the community via the Online Student Support Portal platform. We believe we have found a way to capture the community involvement and assets, and structure them in such a way as to surface them as results in student searches, as this is how students tend to find information. Thus, we focus on the search mechanism, develop data structures that capture links to the community, and enable the search mechanism to bring these community links forward to the student as search results. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c37 c43"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c10">At Illinois Wesleyan University, &ldquo;The majority of students -- of all levels -- exhibited significant difficulties that ranged across nearly every aspect of the search process,&rdquo; according to researchers there. They tended to overuse Google and misuse scholarly databases. They preferred simple database searches to other methods of discovery, but generally exhibited &ldquo;a lack of understanding of search logic&rdquo; that often foiled their attempts to find good sources. (Kolowich, 2011). It has already been noted earlier in this paper that we address the myth of the digital native in constructing a Google-like search. </span><span class="c10 c19">The portal also incorporates context-sensitive help menus on each of the major components.</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">For example, on the page for Geolocation, a student can find additional information by clicking the Help Menu:</span></p><h5 class="c9 c6" id="h.ovfzo7acp4is"><span class="c1"></span></h5><h5 class="c9" id="h.b203objlfunx"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 306.67px;"><img alt="ContextSpecificHelp.jpg" src="images/image44.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 306.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></h5><h5 class="c4" id="h.5jve006ad1oe"><span class="c8">&nbsp;[ VII - 4 ] Context-Sensitive Help: Figure 1. </span></h5><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>Addressing the fourth concern really meant addressing the non-academic challenges faced by students outside the walls of the classroom, on campus, of course, but also, online. This is a concern not only for administrators, but for the students themselves. Beetham noted: </span><span class="c10 c13">&lsquo;At key points in the student journey &ndash; pre-induction, on placements and years abroad, between academic years, and on graduation &ndash; their relationship with the institution is a virtual one. Digital services are critical to establishing and maintaining a sense of belonging across these spaces. And service providers have to find a balance between branding their offer clearly, and blending with students&#39; own preferred services.&rsquo; (Beetham et al 2013). </span><span class="c10">And, in 2014, made this observation: </span><span class="c29 c10 c13 c19">&lsquo;A related concern students have is being pushed too fast towards the public spaces of the open web, in the name of borderless classrooms or third space learning. They understand that this is somewhere they need to develop a presence, but they also see university as safe space where they can play and fail, try out new ways of expressing themselves and new identities. This could be seen as part of a more general need for affiliation and belonging, which is increasingly played out in digital as well as physical spaces.&rsquo; (Beetham 2014).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c10 c45">In addition to developing a search mechanism that pairs with community data, the team also developed public-facing pages that consolidated useful information; no search required. </span><span class="c29 c32 c10">In short, to address the fourth concern, we try to support the supporters. We accommodate the &ldquo;informal&rdquo; support system of friends, family, and community by providing assets they need, and providing a technological path to connect.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c29 c32 c10">Publishing a daily availability of office hours is valuable to any who work, and must break away from work to take care of student matters, such as a parent. Parents need to coordinate time off from work in order to support their child, so a campus-wide hours availability page would be invaluable to them. This is exactly one such feature on the portal. In the example below, one may see that the day of the week this was taken was a Wednesday, and that all offices on campus have their Wednesday hours highlighted. The hours are dynamically generated from the content entered by the stakeholders themselves. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 389.33px;"><img alt="USFSPHours.jpg" src="images/image53.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 389.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c32 c53 c10 c46 c55"></span></p><p class="c42"><span class="c8">[ Section VII - 4 ] Campus-Wide Hours of Availability: Figure 1. </span></p><p class="c42 c6"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c29 c32 c10">However, &ldquo;hours availability&rdquo; is not just about departments, it is about individual people. In addition to the campus-wide office hours page shown above, the portal chat also has the ability to reflect availability. This was mentioned as a way to connect students to academic help for concern 3, and we expand on its application for concern 4, in order to connect students more broadly to help above and beyond academic concerns.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c29 c32 c10">Faculty office hours are particularly valuable. Dr. Maryellen Weimer noted, &ldquo;Although we hold office hours as a way of supporting students, they benefit us as well. That time together helps strengthen our connections with students. We learn of student concerns&mdash;about assignments, course content, and their progress in the major. Perhaps those benefits deserve a mention.&rdquo; (Weimer, 2015). In short, office hours are valuable to all in the education, students and their support system alike. It&rsquo;s important to note that this capability could extend to departments as well as individual faculty or staff members. There is an ability to program the widget so that hours could be displayed on the widget, if administrators so choose. Each individual department could have its own chat widget, and have an indicator as to who was available, and who was offline at the time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c10 c32"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c29 c32 c10">Earlier, we were introduced to the concept of individual widgets that allowed office hours and availability to be set. Below, we see a screenshot of a &ldquo;next step&rdquo; that a faculty, staff member, or department representative would take to set their personal hours of availability. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 394.67px;"><img alt="ChatAvailability.jpg" src="images/image76.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 394.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h5 class="c4" id="h.cwmbwxcvqw2"><span class="c10 c19 c26">[ VII - 4 ] Chat Availability: Figure 1. </span></h5><p class="c12"><span class="c29 c32 c10">In the example above, user &ldquo;Sharon&rdquo; has set her personal widget to display that she is available on chat. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 132.00px;"><img alt="SetPersonalChatWidgetHours.jpg" src="images/image39.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 132.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h5 class="c4" id="h.576wi1mye3st"><span class="c10 c19 c26">[ VII - 4 ] Chat Availability: Figure 2. </span></h5><p class="c12"><span class="c29 c32 c10">Above is a screen-shot of the manner in which widget hours may be set on an individual basis, in advance. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c29 c32 c10">As mentioned, the Online Student Support Portal created paths for assets that may not be under the formal administration of USFSP, such as community assets. It also allows for fluctuation of status. Organizations come and go as funding comes and goes, but what often happens is that the expertise stays in-house, albeit under a different name. This platform has ways to adjust to the fluctuating status, keeping the asset but changing &ldquo;how&rdquo; the information is communicated. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 314.67px;"><img alt="WeeklyChallenger.jpg" src="images/image30.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 314.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h5 class="c4" id="h.g81fjqb56udr"><span class="c10 c19 c26">[ VII - 4 ] Organizational Status: Figure 1. </span></h5><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c29 c32 c10">In the above screenshot, you may see three institutional units listed; The Wellness Center, The Weekly Challenger Initiative, and Veteran&rsquo;s Services. It so happens that funding for the Weekly Challenger was vetoed by Governor Rick Scott in June 2017. That said, the work done by the staff still remains. Note that there are two &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; of units in the list; two of them have the number &ldquo;one&rdquo; associated with them as a unit type, and the Weekly Challenger Initiative has been designated as a unit type number &ldquo;five&rdquo;. When a campus directory is built dynamically from the lists, administration may set which units get displayed on the directory based on the &ldquo;type&rdquo; of unit they are. In the case of the Weekly Challenger Initiative, because funding has been cut (at least for now), the unit was assigned a type that would not display on certain public-facing directories, nor would it display on the office hours page. However, the connections remain. The work is still there, and members from the community can still communicate with USFSP staff -- including via the chat mechanism. This allows work to continue between the USFSP staff and the community they are involved in. It&rsquo;s just a matter of how the group is displayed in directories. It allows for granular control of display. When funding becomes available again, we simply change the unit type from &ldquo;Special Resources&rdquo; (Organizational Type Five) back to &ldquo;Academic Department or Unit&rdquo; (Organizational Type One). </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 314.67px;"><img alt="WeeklyChallengerOrg.png" src="images/image54.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 314.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><h5 class="c4" id="h.fl9v6y4ga5qd"><span class="c8">[ VII - 4 ] Organizational Status: Figure 2. </span></h5><p class="c12"><span>When it came to organizational hierarchy, the portal was designed to accommodate the fluctuations of academic funding, by finding a way to preserve the network channels established by faculty and staff, no matter what the status of funding is. Relationships take a long time to build, and they should not disappear when funding does. Notice that office hours are still available to be changed. For the purposes of this demonstration, the organization has been categorized as a &ldquo;type 5&rdquo; organization, and therefore, the office hours would not display on the &ldquo;campus hours&rdquo; page. That said, the individual chat widget is separate, and would still be able to set and display office hours on any special web page set aside for that purpose. Community connections based on earlier work still have a way to thrive, no matter the status of the organizational group. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c29 c32 c10"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 314.67px;"><img alt="WeeklyChallengerB.png" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 314.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h5 class="c4" id="h.ff98dmktnc87"><span class="c8">[ VII - 4 ] Organizational Status: Figure 3. </span></h5><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">The screen-shot above shows how content is saved in an organizational unit that has temporarily been assigned a category type of &ldquo;5&rdquo;.

Final decisions on &ldquo;what&rdquo; to display &ldquo;where&rdquo; and &ldquo;when&rdquo; would need to be determined by administration, but the point is that the portal architecture allows granular display of content depending upon the nature of the organization. It&rsquo;s is important to remember, that even though the information may not be displayed on a website, the portal architecture can, if adminstration so desires, to allow the contact information for community connections to surface even if there is not a web page for it. The portal was designed to allow multiple ways to connect with the community. And it is community involvement that helps our students in so many ways.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>It&rsquo;s important to note that &ldquo;community&rdquo; can mean a virtual community as well as a physical one. All of us benefit, not just education students, from USFSP&rsquo;s OLITS &ldquo;Monday Minute&rdquo; videos. In the screenshots below,</span><span>&nbsp;we will see Kaya van Beynen provide instruction on how to do search for children&rsquo;s literature, and</span><span>&nbsp;we will see see Karla Kmetz-Morris providing instruction on how to add alternative text to Word and Power Point. The very valuable information in these videos and others belong to all who want to be more inclusive; this means not only the virtual community of educators, but of </span><span class="c13">any</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;business or office that uses Word and Power Point. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">The point is, the portal has the ability to program such results into searches. It&rsquo;s important that the results come up in searches because, as we now understand, that is how students come to find information. It&rsquo;s important to note that, although the capability exists to do this, the capability has not yet been implemented in the portal. We would want to clear this with administrators before implementing the feature. However, should this be allowed to go forward, it would be one way of demonstrating this university&rsquo;s deep commitment to the community.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 457.33px;"><img alt="Libraryb.png" src="images/image71.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 457.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><h5 class="c4" id="h.iu8u3jqlncfk"><span class="c8">[ VII - 4 ] Virtual Community: Figure 1. </span></h5><p class="c12"><span class="c7">In the screen shot above, we see a frame from a video, produced by USFSP&rsquo;s Nelson Poynter Memorial Library, on to search for children&rsquo;s literature. Notice that a community library is featured in this video; the community library is a very valuable community asset. Featuring a community asset in USFSP&rsquo;s video is one way of showing our commitment to community. The set of videos highlighted in this example is but one of many assets that, although created for Education students at USFSP, are in effect, an asset for all in the community. There are quite a few people in the community who have children, so it&rsquo;s easy to see the broad reach this set of videos, produced by the library, could have for all! The value of this is not to be under-estimated; videos such as these make our institution relevant to the everyday lives of the people of our community.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">In the next example, we see another video produced which has broad applications for anyone in the community who uses Word or Power Point, and wishes to ensure that the content is available to those with disabilities.</span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 521.33px;"><img alt="OLITSchannel.jpg" src="images/image43.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 521.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><h5 class="c4" id="h.5tjvyns55spj"><span class="c8">[ VII - 4 ] Virtual Community: Figure 2. </span></h5><p class="c12"><span class="c7">In the screen shot above, we see very valuable information on how to add alternative text to Word and Power Point by Karla Kmetz Morris, Manager of Instructional Design Services, for Online Learning and Instructional Technology Services (OLITS).

It is not the purpose of the portal platform to become a repository; the purpose is to surface information that is buried in silos among departments. The portal platform will understand that this particular link belongs to OLITS, and not another department. The videos created by OLITS will not be put in the same &ldquo;bucket&rdquo; as the videos created by Nelson Poynter Memorial Library, even though they are both videos on the Youtube channel. This will enable much more targeted (and therefore convenient) searches for users.

This has already been done for Department descriptions and locations; tests on this have been successful. However, administrative approval should be set before building a mechanism by which searches may bring up &ldquo;informal&rdquo; contacts of the community that are involved with USFSP. The code libraries to accomplish this have already been developed in-house by Dr. Frechette, and are reusable for this purpose. However, the process should be reviewed by administrators before implementing it. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>It&rsquo;s important to note, that it is not the purpose of the portal to serve as a repository of content. The purpose of the portal is to serve as a repository of </span><span class="c13">connections</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;between people, and if administration deems it appropriate, to surface these connections out of silos. We believe this may be one of the data points, &ldquo;More out of silos to a shared vision&rdquo;, as described in the &ldquo;Key Shifts&rdquo;, (i.e. Shifting from a culture of&hellip;.to a new progressive thinking culture) for Strategic Goal #2: Student Success and Culture.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">The case of the local community involved with Weekly Challenger Newspaper may serve as an example on how community connections may be preserved, and surfaced into search results (if administration were to approve it). Newspaper editor Cleveland Johnson founded the paper in 1967 as a way to tell the story of the black community in St. Petersburg. In an interview with Bay News 9 reporter Cait Mc Vey, Lyn Johnson, his daughter, said of her father, &ldquo;That was his goal. To highlight the good in the black community&rdquo; (McVey, 2016). The initiative to preserve the issues of the Weekly Challenger was undertaken by USFSP. This isn&rsquo;t just about archiving old editions of the newspaper, it was about preserving community history, and maintaining personal community connections.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">Community connections help our students navigate through first-time college experience, so we want to make sure that we keep the personal connections, no matter what else is happening administratively. Of course, email accomplishes that. But keeping connections via email only don&rsquo;t give these connections a way to surface to the student through searches, or special web pages. This platform allows us to surface the community connections through targeted searches (if approved by the administration).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">So, how would the Online Student Support Portal incorporate such assets into student searches? There&rsquo;s a different path for these connections than what was described for the video channels produced at USFSP. This is because the portal takes advantage of and ability to capture and route two-way communication, very specifically between stakeholders at USFSP, and members of the local community. That connection is already in place via email, but as was mentioned earlier, but we want to take that connection out of silos. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">The portal architecture has a capability whereby &ldquo;departments&rdquo; or units that have special status or are unofficial may be set up; in the current configuration of the portal, such departments would not display on any official site at USFSP. Yet, content associated with such departments is preserved. In this example case, some of the content would be the community connections. It is the stakeholders themselves who input the connections with the community. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">In our example, and for the purposes of a demonstration, the Weekly Challenger Initiative has been temporarily assigned a category 5, &ldquo;Special Resources&rdquo;. The final determination of the category would be made by administrators, of course. In this demonstration case, we are in the process of adding users to the group.

The portal will function on mobile devices as well as a desktop. Because of the team&rsquo;s commitment to accessibility, we felt we could build-in certain other features that would help many of our students with disabilities. We can&rsquo;t do it all, but we felt we could make some real headway in reducing a need for specialized software for some of the more common problems. This aligns with our university&rsquo;s core values,&rdquo;Student-Centered Success&rdquo; and </span><span class="c7">&ldquo;Inclusion of Differences&rdquo; of course.

Mark Durand noted:</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">It has been hypothesized that factors such as stimulus satiation or choice may account for this rate of responding by many individuals in these studies (Durand, 1990). Other research suggests that choice, under certain circumstances, may in itself have a reinforcing effect (Fisher, Thompson, Piazza, Crosland, &amp; Gotjen, 1997; Hanley et al., 1997). (Durand et al., 1999). Additional research by Dewsbury, et al noted &ldquo;..control of the technology becomes imperative in enhancing the sense of independence due to self-determination and personal liberties (Dewsbury, et al., 2003).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>Most would agree on instinct that the greater the sense of independence and self-determination, the better. Beyond the simple human issue of the need for self-worth, does a sense of independence and self-determination aid student success? According to the American Psychological Association, yes. &ldquo;</span><span class="c10">An enormous amount of research shows the importance of self-determination (i.e., autonomy) for students in elementary school through college for enhancing learning and improving important post-school outcomes.</span><span class="c7">&rdquo;(APA, n.d.). Consequently, the design of the portal platform took every advantage possible to embed, where possible, an ability to work independent of the need for special software or hardware to be added. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>Cost was another factor to be considered. </span><span class="c7">Cost and access to the Internet are one of the factors that Lin Muilenburg and Zane Berge noted as a barriers to online learning (Muilenburg, Berge, 2007). A platform designed mobile-first removes much of the cost by allow students to work from their phones, and to be able to access important content from devices which are low cost -- and just as importantly -- from locations that do not necessarily deliver high-bandwidth. For this reason, the USFSP Online Student Support portal was built mobile-first, using a framework that enabled tapping on mobile would work just as well as clicking on a button. Another way to reduce costs is to remove the requirement for special software, where possible. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 308.00px;"><img alt="LowVisionHelp19June1.jpg" src="images/image40.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 308.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><h5 class="c4" id="h.w60plc7o3bht"><span class="c10 c19 c26">[ VII - 6 ] Figure 1. </span></h5><h5 class="c9" id="h.2k6h4ai9mxo8"><span class="c7">Low-Vision Help baked into the Online Student Support Portal.

Accessibility for students with disabilities is still a challenge.</span></h4><h5 class="c9" id="h.9x5e93n1g68m"><span class="c8">Various systems and software packages provide a wide range of support and access to students with disabilities.</span></h5><h5 class="c9" id="h.qw0uuif1d3yt"><span class="c29 c10 c13 c19">How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal: </span></h5><h5 class="c9" id="h.t62bsfhj9uc"><span class="c29 c10 c13 c19">A student with multiple disabilities was part and parcel to the process of designing and building the portal, and his input was integral in designing the User Interface. Standard accessibility practices were employed, but also, because the student was alongside at all points of the design process, new, one-of-a-kind accessibility initiatives were created -- one of which is absolutely unique to USFSP. </span></h5><h5 class="c9" id="h.stf8l9xkbxim"><span class="c29 c10 c13 c19">Additionally, because the search function plays an extremely large role to those with disabilities, a specialized search function was developed to work specifically with USFSP databases, enabling a very targeted, context-sensitive search result. It is a simple but powerful initiative that allows students with disabilities to find information on a timely basis on par with those who do not have disabilities. This allowed us to substantially meet the definition of &ldquo;accessible&rdquo; as defined by the Office of Civil Rights and the U.S. Department of Education regarding inaccessible IT.</span></h5><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c27 c38 c19 c26">Details and Background for the design decisions to address this concern.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">According to Shuang, most information is presented in a textual format, but textual display may not always be the best solution. He noted that users may have difficulties in reading and comprehending complex texts, and that users of handheld devices cannot read much text information on a small screen. A recommendation was to use multimodal interfaces, as multimodal interfaces provide a logical solution by delivering information through multiple sensory modalities. (Shuang, X. et al 2008). We had noted the same issues, and found that they were amplified for those with disabilities. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">To address this, we employed a multi-pronged approach. First, a section of the interface was set aside to allow for very large text, easily visible. Next, this particular part of the interface incorporated a special feature for those with weak motor skills, enabling a user to cycle through alternate letters should one be entered accidently. Finally, the voice component was developed in parallel, so that the interface could function in a manner similar to Dragon Naturally Speaking, but free, without charge, and without need to train the software.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>In effect, this platform supports self-determination. Pride should not be underestimated as a force in the well-being of any student -- or anybody, for that matter. It&rsquo;s known that there are students on campus, eligible for assistance through the USFSP Disabilities office, who will not self-identify as having a disability. This platform allows students to do more for themselves, reducing the amount of time they need to ask someone for help; put simply, it helps students achieve self-determination. As noted earlier, this is important. A good description of self-determination is as follows: &ldquo;</span><span>Self-determination is a concept familiar to special educators and encompasses decision making, goal setting, self-awareness, self-advocacy, and self-monitoring&rdquo; (Lombardi et al, 2016). However, it should be noted that although efforts to provide a setting that enables self-determination was done to help foster successful outcomes for students with disabilities, the implications apply to </span><span class="c13">all</span><span>&nbsp;students. The American Psychological Association noted the practical application of self-determination theory: &ldquo;</span><span class="c10">Researchers have developed and evaluated instructional interventions and supports to encourage self-determination for all students, with many of these programs designed for use by students with disabilities.&rdquo; (APA, n.d.).</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>And, it helps with finances. By providing a platform that can allow students to use voice input when their hands do not work well, they are spared the tremendous expense of software such as Dragon Naturally Speaking, which although was not designed as assistive technology, is used by many as such. Dragon Naturally Speaking is not cheap, and purchasing it is not a casual expense, particularly for students, and even more so for students with disabilities, who suffer significant financial burdens because of their disabilities. </span><span class="c1">According to research done by the authors of the paper, &ldquo;College students with disabilities; Common on campus, uncommon in the literature&rdquo;, the following was noted: Twenty-three of the interviewed students and 358 of the surveyed students reported a physical disability. A high proportion (41%) of students indicated they needed adaptions to access computers (Gelbar et al, 2105).</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 297.33px;"><img alt="CourseLowVisionScreen1.jpg" src="images/image58.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 297.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c7"></span></p><h5 class="c4" id="h.qxh9ybtn931o"><span class="c27 c38 c19 c26">[ VII- 9 ] Figure - 1</span></h5><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><h5 class="c9" id="h.fjq8sew35vbw"><span class="c19 c26">&nbsp;Prototype of embedded Accessibility Initiative</span></h5><p class="c2"><span class="c7">The above screen-shot shows the default setting for the Courses page.

All components for search work on this page, both the accessibility initiative, and the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; the component for those with normal vision.

To someone who relied on Dragon Naturally Speaking, even this simple act was problematic. Trying to grab control of a drop-down menu, and then navigate with Dragon Naturally Speaking was difficult and time-consuming, even to experienced users. Such searches were complicated by the fact that once a student was able to make a selection, the nature of Dragon Naturally Speaking software would be such that if a student moved down the page to refine the search, earlier choices would be &ldquo;lost&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">Our answer to the problem, as we mentioned earlier, was to bring the content to the student, rather than have the student go find the content. This was applicable to all students, not just those with disabilities, but for students with disabilities, this is a major benefit. In the case of those who rely on Dragon Naturally Speaking, we had to make the platform able to incorporate voice recognition technology.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The next screenshots show the prototype of how voice recognition technology was incorporated into the Accessibility Initiative. </span><span class="c7">In the first example, we demonstrate the prototype voice input component that allows one to search by voice. In this screenshot of the functional prototype, we may see that the ability to enter a search via voice has been activated, as the microphone has turned red. (We intend to fine tune this further, as a color-blind person may not be able to detect a change in color). The ability to use voice to search is a boon to those who have motor skills problems with their hands. We&rsquo;ll be looking for Anthropology Courses, using a subject code of ANT. We do not make the student spell out the whole word, &ldquo;Anthropology&rdquo; (although that is an option if the student so desires to search in that manner).</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><h5 class="c4" id="h.704hojytatjp"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 253.33px;"><img alt="CourseLowVisionScreen2.jpg" src="images/image22.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 253.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></h5><h5 class="c4" id="h.auo24bszb5gr"><span class="c27 c38 c19 c26">[VII- 9] Figure - 3 </span></h5><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><h5 class="c9" id="h.xgytt7h7nw9x"><span class="c19 c26">The user enters the letters, &ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;n&rdquo;, &ldquo;t&rdquo;</span></h5><h5 class="c9" id="h.5mkgdx3exa83"><span class="c7">The user has activated the voice component, as seen by the microphone turning a red color.

We did take especial note one of the recent cases, for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida Juan Carlos Gil, Plaintiff v. Winn Dixie Stores, Inc., Defendant Civil Action No. 16-23020-Civ-Scola, Judge Scola noted that </span><span class="c10 c13 c35">&ldquo;Winn-Dixie&rsquo;s website is heavily integrated with, and in many ways operates as a gateway to, Winn-Dixie&rsquo;s physical store locations.&rdquo; </span></h5><p class="c12"><span class="c37 c26">More information on portal initiatives to address this item:</span></p><h5 class="c9" id="h.amubzkn5v8h7"><span class="c29 c33">We found that the university had already done an amazing job of making information that was legally obliged to supply readily accessible, and online. We felt that one significant contribution that the portal platform could add to the already great job done by the university was to employ the search mechanism developed in-house. Because students use the search function so heavily, we felt that the custom search mechanism would be a fit to help students get the information they need. As we have said before, this platform innovates by bringing the content to the student, rather than having the student go find the content. </span></h5><h5 class="c9" id="h.o4jb92wnu2wa"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s important to note that the Online Student Support Portal works as an integrated platform, however. In order for the search mechanism to work, stakeholders would have to input the reports. That said, control would be totally in the hands of the stakeholders. If a revision was necessary, it&rsquo;s easy for them to make the revision and publish immediately. There&rsquo;s no need to go through a webmaster. If change needs to happen immediately, then change happens immediately.</span></h5><h5 class="c9" id="h.67qs08o9rsje"><span class="c1">Please see section VII-5 for more details on &ldquo;how&rdquo; the reports would be input by the stakeholder.</span></h5><p class="c12"><span class="c7">As envisioned, by inputting a report into the Online Student Support Portal, two results are achieved, simultaneously: First, the report shows up on the consolidated reports page. Second, the report becomes part of the data that makes itself available to the artificial intelligence developed in-house. In effect, killing two birds with one stone. The portal has not yet been configured to do this, as we feel that to do this would require administrative authorization and coordination. More harm than good if some departments used the portal platform to load important documents, and others did not. Users would not have a consistent experience, and think they were doing something wrong if important reports came up only sporadically through searches. That said, Dr. Frechette has already developed a code suite that may be applied to this purpose, should the decision be made to move forward with this. </span></p><h5 class="c4" id="h.xr05mq3cy1bw"><span class="c5">VIII MORE INFORMATION ON PORTAL FEATURES</span></h5><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.bjcnkjp1ktoc"><span class="c5">1. Overall.</span></h4><h5 class="c9" id="h.gc2jxv7rs4pf"><span class="c8">Content should be available and accessible regardless of device.</span></h5><h5 class="c9" id="h.4jtymnuyrq6i"><span class="c8">Ways in which this was addressed: Develop the platform with a mobile-first platform, ensuring USFSP branding is in place, bringing forward USFSP-specific assets when search is used, and using accessibility as a strategy, not a tactic.</span></h5><p class="c12"><span>The platform was developed as a mobile-first one, and tries to take advantage of capabilities available on mobile devices to enhance the student experience. There is only one platform, not multiple. Specifically, the same technology that works on desktops works on mobile phones. There is not a special &ldquo;app&rdquo; version of the site. This is by design. The use of apps is on the decline. &ldquo;</span><span class="c10">it has almost been </span><span class="c10"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://qz.com/253618/most-smartphone-users-download-zero-apps-per-month/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1499781808800000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH7bgwS4ZGHfivOddAUpPZN3uKaMA">a year since research showed</a></span><span class="c10">&nbsp;the average US smartphone doesn&rsquo;t download even a single app per month</span><span class="c10">.</span><span>&rdquo; (Benson, 2016). </span><span class="c10">Nearly 1 in 4 people abandon mobile apps after only one use. (Perez, 2016). Consequently, the platform was built to incorporate &ldquo;app&rdquo; features directly into the platform. The platform will display one set of behaviors if viewed on a desktop, or will display a different set of behaviors if viewed on a phone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">One example is the inclusion of geolocation coordinates in a database to match the location of the buildings on campus, allowing students to plug in coordinates into their GPS devices or phones and navigate to campus. In the example below, the latitude and longitude of Nelson Poynter Memorial Library was entered into a custom data table. The intent is to be able to coordinate the graphics of a campus map with the coordinates of the location, so that students, family, and friends may take advantage of these coordinates for devices capable of geolocation. The advantage, of course, is that no privacy concerns are in place here -- these are locations of public buildings, public facilities -- but the data would provide great assistance to those who want to take advantage of it. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">The platform was developed mobile-first, and is operable on mobile devices, but follow-up work is needed. Kearns noted that &ldquo;While mobile increases worker agility and allows them to work remotely the pervasiveness and evolution of these devices creates a special threat because policies and controls for computers are not sufficiently broad to cover the new threats these devices pose&rdquo; (Kearns, 2016). </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>The next feature that supports the ability to make content</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;available and accessible regardless of device is the very high incorporation of the special search capability, developed in-house. To every point possible, it tries to deliver information via text response, rather than the download of files, such as Word documents or .pdf files. This is because often, unless a staff member knows how to make such documents accessible -- </span><span class="c10 c13">and has the time to do so </span><span class="c1">-- such documents are often inadvertent barriers to screen readers. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c10">To get a feel for the time that it takes to make such documents accessible, please see the very valuable instruction offered by Karla Kmetz in the OLITS video, </span><span class="c7">&ldquo;Monday Minute: Alt Text in Word and PowerPoint &ldquo; found at this url on YouTube:</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c51 c64"><a class="c20" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DReoT1LeZSlw&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1499781808801000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFxkdaOuLDIkIi255UnvozKagMWQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReoT1LeZSlw</a></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>The point is, as far as accessibility is concerned, all other things being equal, anything that may be done to remove the need for special-handling of documents for accessibility, such as using a platform that delivers screen-readable html text, is preferable to a platform that houses documents which may or may not be accessible. It&rsquo;s important to note that there are times which the best option is </span><span class="c13">not</span><span>&nbsp;html text, but a .pdf file or other similar such format, and that is for anything involving legal matters. Such documents </span><span class="c13">should </span><span class="c7">be in a .pdf format, so that changes are not easy or casual. That said, it would be helpful to have an html &ldquo;web&rdquo; version available of the same document for screen-readers, and/or for those who are unable to afford computers with the ability to download such documents.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">The are really two ways one may interpret the terms, &ldquo;making content accessible&rdquo;. There are the terms &ldquo;making content accessible&rdquo; as they imply, &ldquo;accessibility&rdquo; for those with screen readers and other assistive technology, and there are the terms &ldquo;making content accessible&rdquo; as they imply the ability for a device to access content. To this second interpretation, the platform should be able to deliver content no matter the device used. It&rsquo;s difficult for those using phones as their access to the Internet to download files, so the more that the platform may deliver the content as text, instead of a downloadable file, the more mobile friendly the platform will be for the users. It is not the point of the platform to be a repository of documents. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>Finally, a special feature that supports the ability to make content</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;available and accessible regardless of device is the special, built-in accessibility initiative for the platform. Although this accessibility cannot help all people, it certainly can make a difference in the lives of many, saving them the expense of acquiring special software, that often must be paired with certain browsers or hardware packages. This one-of-a-kind initiative was developed in-house by Dr. Frechette, and is unique to USFSP.</span></p><p class="c12"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.eaqq0yifjv4l"><span class="c5">2.

This is the part of the portal that allows faculty and staff to set up their personal notification preferences, in order to make it convenient on their terms to communicate with students, while ensuring that student questions do not fall through the cracks.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 298.67px;"><img alt="LoggedIn1.jpg" src="images/image18.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 298.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h5 class="c4" id="h.5yzad0w9yp3v"><span class="c27 c38 c19 c26">[ VIII - 2 ] Logged In: Figure - 1 </span></h5><p class="c12"><span class="c7">In the screenshot above, you may see that user &ldquo;Sharon&rdquo; has logged in, and has a flag indicating that a message awaits.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 298.67px;"><img alt="LoggedIn2.jpg" src="images/image27.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 298.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h5 class="c4" id="h.9nfm2kvyxn"><span class="c27 c38 c19 c26">[ VIII - 2 ] Logged In: Figure - 2</span></h5><h5 class="c9" id="h.6h19fj1liz47"><span class="c29 c33">Clicking on her name, user &ldquo;Sharon&rdquo; is taken to her profile page.

Specifically, the student could receive alerts through Twitter when responses have been added to her chat questions.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c7">In this way, the Portal can integrate with the social and mobile technologies students are already familiar with, including SMS and texting technologies. Research has shown that social media has a role in emergencies and a particular application for those with disabilities. Morris notes that &ldquo;levels of use of social media in general are high for people with disabilities, as well as for the general population.&rdquo; (Morris et al., 2014) We are not seeking to redefine that role -- only to be ready for it should it come our way.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span>Conversations with a USFSP student with multiple disabilities who worked with us on the project reinforce the value of allowing easy access to the two-way, interactive, personalized communication tools built into the portal. We knew that the initiatives we described above would offer more than convenience. In some cases, they could even be a life-saver.</span></p><p class="c28 c6"><span class="c27 c38 c19 c26"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6 c28"><span class="c27 c38 c19 c26"></span></p><p class="c28 c6"><span class="c27 c38 c19 c26"></span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.9c84i5ancvbm"><span class="c24">5.

Functionality was built first, and overlaid with user interfaces last. To that end, most of the work that remains to be done with the portal is user testing, and finalizing the interfaces based on the results of the testing. More specifically, the following tasks need to be completed:</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><ol class="c47 lst-kix_glcl0b4bcz4f-0 start" start="1"><li class="c2 c23"><span class="c1">To ensure the stability and integrity of the databases, data sanitization must be added to all form fields across the application.</span></li><li class="c2 c23"><span class="c1">Conduct significant user testing, to include mobile testing, to finalize the interface.</span></li><li class="c2 c23"><span class="c1">Coordinate with marketing to add official USFSP colors and visuals.</span></li><li class="c2 c23"><span class="c1">Add WAI-ARIA for screen-readers. This should wait until the interface is finalized after user-testing, because content is generated dynamically which, in turn, affects how the content will be announced to screen-readers. Adding WAI-ARIA for screen-readers at the wrong point in time will do far more harm than good.</span></li><li class="c2 c23"><span class="c1">Follow-on, additional testing with screen-readers is necessary after the first and second steps above have been completed. For screen-reader testing to be meaningful, it can take place only after the user interface has been finalized.</span></li><li class="c2 c23"><span class="c1">Add data to certain tables for the artificial intelligence component of the portal. Currently, only enough data is in place to enable proof-of-concept demonstrations.</span></li><li class="c2 c23"><span class="c1">Modify the &ldquo;roles&rdquo; functionality from the simple one it is now to the much more sophisticated and powerful version that has been designed by Dr. Frechette.</span></li><li class="c2 c23"><span class="c1">Create an additional specialized interface for managers and staff, including</span></li></ol><p class="c2 c30"><span class="c1">a. an interface to allow managers to assign roles to staff;</span></p><p class="c2 c30"><span class="c1">b. an interface to allow staff to add specialized terms to teach the artificial intelligence;</span></p><p class="c2 c30"><span class="c1">c. an interface to allow staff to enter special FAQs based on student questions;</span></p><p class="c2 c30"><span class="c1">d. an interface to allow staff to input coordinates for map function.</span></p><ol class="c47 lst-kix_glcl0b4bcz4f-0" start="9"><li class="c2 c23"><span class="c1">Coordinate with Information Technology, test for domain cross-functionality, to ensure that all URLs/URIs necessary for content delivery are white-listed. </span></li><li class="c2 c23"><span class="c1">Set up a toggle for the chat function to allow the download of a transcript for accessibility purposes.</span></li></ol><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c14 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c5">CONCLUSION</span></p><p class="c14 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We would like to thank many for the opportunity to develop this one-of-a-kind, unique, Online Student Support Portal.
