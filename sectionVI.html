		   <h3>Unseen Costs of Assistive Technology</h3>
		   <h4>Time Management becomes a fierce issue.</h4>
		   <ol>
		      <li>Time Spent Obtaining Accessibility Equipment.<br /><h5>Much assistive technology is expensive.  Disabiities usually forces a financial hardship, and those who are dependent upon the technology must fill out a lot of paperwork.  Students try to fill out the forms themselves.  This is a matter of pride.  If they do, however, they may run past the "due" date of the application, and get refused the equipment. </h5></li>
		  <li>Added Cost of the Involvement of Others<h5>Some students cannot fill out a form, or fill it out in a timely manner that ensures funding applications are sent on time.  Consequently, a caregiver or case-worker of some sort needs to be involved.</h5></li>

	 <h3>Reduce Inefficiencies</h3>	
	 <h4>Destroy Redundancy, its a productivity killer</h4>
One must support the supporters.   In order to connect students to the help they need, they must be able to connect to the right expertise.  Half of the equation is getting the right answer to the student, and the other half of the equation is ensuring that the experts populate the data.
 </div><br />
		   
 <div>
	 <h3>Bring information to the student rather than have him look for it.</h3>
	 <h4>Streamline Workflow for the student</h4>
	 <h4>By automation (AI) dramatic reduction in process time</h4>
Technology can bring students the information, but unless that technology also captures accurate and timely information, the student would not receive accurate information.  The problem is that the information is in silos.
 </div><br />
		   
<div>
	<h3>Support the supporters</h3>
	<h4>Streamline Workflow for the Supporters</h4>
Tough to break out of silos.     
See the article, "How Inefficient Processes Are Hurting Your Company" at this link: <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/286084">https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/286084</a>

</div>
		   
<div>
Breaking out of silos was accomplished by controlling access to expertise management, but programmatically putting it into the same bucket (database) for the AI.  The experts in the silos themselves inform the data that informs the AI. 


</div><br />
		   
<div>
By streamlining an interface, much less "servicing" is needed by those who maintain the code, especially as it relates to markup for screen-readers

	<h5>Siloed, difficult-to-use business systems complicate processes and hamper operations. Is this true of your organization?</h5>
	<h5>From the section on system integration: "problems “arise because they have different internal systems/applications that don’t ‘talk’ to each other," while 43 percent of workers surveyed said they often have to copy/paste or rekey in information."</h5>
