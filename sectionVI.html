		   <h3>Time Management: Hidden Costs</h3><br />
		   <h4>Costs to the Student</h4>
		   <ol>
		    <li><h5>Time Spent Obtaining Accessibility Equipment</h5><p>Much assistive technology is expensive.  Disabiities usually forces a financial hardship, and those who are dependent upon the technology must fill out a lot of paperwork.  Students try to fill out the forms themselves.  This is a matter of pride.  If they do, however, they may run past the "due" date of the application, and get refused the equipment. </p></li>
		   <li><h5>Added Cost of the Involvement of Others</h5><p>Some students cannot fill out a form, or fill it out in a timely manner that ensures funding applications are sent on time.  Consequently, a caregiver or case-worker of some sort needs to be involved.</p></li>
		   <li><h5>Less Time Available to Gain Expertise</h5><p>There is much expertise gained from daily activities and daily life that may be taken for granted by those with the full facility of their limbs and vision.  Students with disabilites are usually so busy fighting the process that they dont have time to gain the common expertise most of us take for granted, such as the location of common help files. This very fact slows them down in getting help.</p></li>
		   <li><h5>Technology Doesnt Play Nice With Its Host</h5>There are many applications that work fine until assistive technology software in installed in concert with the application.  Life on the computer slows, stalls, and stops because too much is going on simultaneously. When they call to ask for help, they are sometimes met with hostility and an assumed stupidity that the student themself has caused the problem, rather than the accessibility application.  This is a cost to the student's energy to handle the situation, and trust of the system that is supposed to be helping him.</li>	   
		   </ol>
		 <h4>Costs to the Support Staff</h4>
		   <ol>
			 <li><h5>Maintaining a Technology-Operating System Matrix</h5><p> Information Technology professionals must ensure that they have the right OS, and the right version of OS, for each version of assistant technology.  This is time consuming and costly to maintain.</p></li>		   
		   <li><h5>Staff and Faculty must ensure that documents for which they are legally obligated to provide are accessible</h5><p>They must take training on how to make a pdf file accessible, for example, or ensure that the machines that do this for them are producing documents that are readable by assistive technology. Different kinds of documents take different kinds of training.  There is a different skill set in making a pdf accessible, for example, than there is for making a Word document accessible.</p></li>
		<li><h5>Ensuring Space is Available</h5><p>For the physical world, this means space and room enough not only for the accessibility equipment, but for wheelchairs and other equipment used by the student. Internet access and sufficient processing power for the workstation must be ensured, as the accessibility software run in concert with other software commonly used by students typically puts extra demands on the workstation.</p></li>
		<li><h5>Time spent on paperwork justifying the extra expenses</h5><p>Needs are not intuitive to managers who hold the pursestrings, so often, considerable time must be spent detailing why "extra" and "more expensive" accounerments are needed to provide workstations for students with disabilities.</p></li>

	 <h3>Solution: Reduce Inefficiencies</h4>
	 <h4>Streamline Workflow for the student: Bring information to the student rather than have him look for it.</h4>
	 <p>Automation, specifically, Artificial Intelligence (AI), can enable a dramatic reduction in the time it takes for student to find information, and this is esepcially true for students with disabilities</p>
<p>Technology can bring students the information, but unless that technology also captures accurate and timely information, the student would not receive accurate information.</p>
	 <h4>Destroy Redundancy, its a productivity killer</h4>
	 <p>The problem is that the information is in silos.  There are several repetitive steps involved in going down silos, only to find that the particlar silo does not have the necessary information, and having to go back up to the beginning, go "sideways", and down another silo.  This is physically and intellectually draining for all, and especially so for those with disabilities.</p>
 </div><br />
		   
<div>
	<h3>Solution: Support the Supporters</h3>
	<p>Enable the supporters by removing the typical requirements that roadblock their ability to get involved and support the student on their behalf.  Much of this involves showing students what they need to register for class only after they have logged in.  For many reasons, logins are an accessibility hardship.  By making information that "can" be publicly available, available, then the care-giver or case-worker will be in a better position to help the student.</p>
	<p>This involves larger help than may first be realized.  Often, if a student must come to campus, there are hidden costs of arranging transportation, as well as, arranging for the care-giver or case-worker to accompany the student, all of which are extraordinary demands on time and resources.</p>

</div>
		   
<div>
Breaking out of silos was accomplished by controlling access to expertise management, but programmatically putting it into the same bucket (database) for the AI.  The experts in the silos themselves inform the data that informs the AI.

By streamlining an interface, much less "servicing" is needed by those who maintain the code, especially as it relates to markup for screen-readers
