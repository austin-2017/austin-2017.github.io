		   <h3>Integration Matters</h3><br />
		   <h4>It's the only way to ensure that different modes of access reach the same content.</h4>
		   <ol>
		   <li><h5>One data base.  Multiple paths of entry to it.</h5>
		   <p>This allows for different learning styles and preferences, and allows multiple channels of access for those with disabilities who may not have full use of their limbs or eyes</h5></li>  
		   </ol>
		 <h4>No breaks or disconnects between different systems</h4>
		   <ol>
		<li><h5>AS in the physical world, in the virtual world, where different systems meet, there is weakness in the join, and risk that something will fall through the cracks</h5></li>		   
		   <li><h5>Standardization matters, both for the stakeholders and for maintenance.</h5><p>The fewer moving parts, the less need for maintenance, and the less training needed for each component.</p></li>	   
		   </ol>
		   <h4>Affordability Issues</h4>
		   <ol>
		     <li><h5>Ultimate costs are fewer.</h5><p>Although initial costs may be higher, by ensuring solid integration, then we ensure the platform is extensible, and at low cost.  No new systems are needed to be added for new features. It's a form of standardization.  Because building blocks are so similar on an integrated system, training in one component (block or module) almost guarantees familiarity with and competence in other components (blocks or modules)</p></li>

			 <h4>Portal Initiative: Integrate Accessibility Features right into the Portal Platform.</h4>
			 <h5>As much as possible, a student with disabilities should never have to download special software in order to access content on the website.  Build in, rather than force a student to download, what he needs. </h5>
			 <p>Integration of this nature will help the student move seamlessless across content, without worry that his assistive technology will work on the school computer, that the technology will be available to him no matter where he goes, or that the technology he needs crashes his workstation or phone.</p>
			</div><br />
			  
			<h4>Portal Initiative: Ensure the platform does nothing to fight Assistive Technology if the student chooses to use it.</h4>
			 <h5>As much as possible, use very basic HTML markup -- just do it -- with innovation. </h5>
			 <p>Any initiatives SHOULD NOT INTERFERE with commonly used techniques by students with disabilities using assistive technology.  For example, we found that students who use Dragon Naturally Speaking use the copy-and-paste feature frequently.  We had to ensure that our interface did not interfere with that, and still continued to work for the student.  In other words, ensure that the platform accepts the integration of standard assistive technology, as well as ensuring that it in and of itself is an integrated platform.</p>

We wanted to make sure that this platform allowed a student to continue working in the manner by which he was accustomed.  It's just as important to be able to "accept" integration of other applications as it is for the platform to be integrated within itself.  This video has no audio.</h5></div>
