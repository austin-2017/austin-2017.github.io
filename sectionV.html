<strong>1. Students find it confusing and difficult to obtain information.</strong><br /><br />
Information about online learning appears in different places and formats. Students aren’t sure where to look or how to interpret the information they receive.<br /><br />

This concern really encompasses two distinct components; confusion, and difficulty. How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal: <br /><br />
To address difficulty: The portal was designed to bring information to the student, rather than have the student search for information. This was accomplished via custom code, developed in-house, and unique to USFSP.<br /><br /> 
To address confusion: The portal structure was developed to work around centralized repositories, customized to USFSP and populated by authoritative USFSP stakeholders. This content is dynamically generated, meaning, as soon as a stakeholder updates the information, the information is immediately available to students. No middle-man is required.<br /><br />
To address confusion: The portal was designed to bridge the “two kinds” of content silos: Technological, and Organizational. The portal provides a technological path to cross silos, but the technology alone is not enough. Organizational expertise is made available via keywords so that student concerns may be forwarded to an appropriate organizational unit by consulting a keyword list. This enables a bridge across silos not only from a technical standpoint, but an informational one also. It enables a way to find the expertise of other departments. The keywords are maintained by the stakeholders themselves.<br /><br />
</div><br />

<strong>2. It’s a challenge to balance student privacy with the transparency needed to promote student safety.</strong><br /><br />
Finding the right balance between protecting and disseminating information is critical.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal:<br /><br /> 
A “Help” drop-down menu available on every public-facing page, with the special note that if there is an emergency, to call 9-1-1.<br /><br /> 
Develop a chat platform that allowed anonymous and private conversation for students, strengthened by a keyword feature, unique to USFSP, that supported staff in the routing of the chat to an appropriate authority. This includes the ability to list and publicize special USF system after-hours support for USFSP students, and the ability to list off-campus support institutions, such as area hospitals. On the recommendation of one of our students with disabilities, geolocation features were incorporated for mobile devices. To address privacy concerns, permission must be enabled before geolocation is enabled.<br /><br />
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens third paragraph --> 
<strong>3. Some students are unprepared for online learning.</strong><br /><br />
Many students approach online learning with misconceptions about the rigor required of the experience.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal:<br /><br /> 
To address connecting students with the people who can help them learn how to handle rigorous requirements: Connect students to librarians, appropriate support staff, and university professors in a more robust and targeted manner, technologically speaking.<br /><br />
To address the problem that students may not be as proficient with digital technology as we may assume: Address the myth of the Digital Native. The myth of the Digital Native assumes that students are able to find help easily on digital platforms, because they have been using them most of their lives. While it is true that students are familiar with these platforms, they are not necessarily familiar with how to search for help using them. Students rely heavily on Google, but they are not very good at customizing searches to get targeted results. The portal takes advantage of an interface that is Google-like in function, to make the student feel comfortable. Under the hood, however, the database is built to deliver targeted resources for students to get to the help they need. This is done first, through a Google-like search, then via chat, or email. From there, authoritative resources can connect with the student, directing him to the appropriate resources, for example, the Student Success Center or the Student Technology Center.<br /><br />
</div><br />
 <div><!-- opens fourth paragraph --> 

<strong>4. Some students are unprepared for college.</strong><br /><br />
The transition from high school to college challenges many incoming students.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal:<br /><br />
In many ways, the features for connecting students to appropriate help in item 3 also had direct applications to addressing the concerns in item 4. There’s a nuance of difference between the concerns in item 3 and in item 4, however, in that item 3, as worded, tends to align with academic concerns, whereas the concerns in item 4 tend to align with concerns young people face when encountering a college environment for the first time.<br /><br />
To address connecting students with the people who can help them fit in with college culture: Connect students to appropriate support staff and community assets in a more robust and targeted manner, technologically speaking. In terms of addressing a young person’s outreach for help, the portal was designed to be able to address questions asked anonymously.<br /><br /> 
To help young students embrace the college culture outside the walls of the classroom: Incorporate community connections, technologically speaking.<br /><br /> 
</div><br />
 <div><!-- opens fifth paragraph --> 
<strong>5. Failure to provide timely, comprehensive support to a growing online student body may interfere with our alignment with SACS requirements.</strong><br /><br />
As the portion of instruction delivered online increases, so does the importance of providing adequate support services.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal:<br /><br />
Create special interfaces to allow stakeholders to tag reports necessary to SACS, and create a special, public-facing page, dynamically populated by the stakeholders themselves. This dynamically-populated page allows auditors to search for reports relevant to SACS and other important institutions.<br /><br />
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens sixth paragraph --> 

<strong>6. Existing support systems serve students to varying degrees, depending on the device from which they are accessed and the student’s needs.</strong><br /><br />
Some information is difficult to access on mobile devices or without the use of downloadable plugins. Some students require access to specialized software, depending on their major.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal:<br /><br />
To address the difficulty of accessing the content on mobile devices, the platform was developed as a mobile-first one. If a web site is available on mobile platforms, it will be available anywhere.<br /><br />
To address the issue of downloadable software/plugins: An Accessibility Initiative baked into the portal was designed by Dr. Casey Frechette in concert with USFSP student Robert Beasey. This special feature, unique to USFSP, allows students with certain disabilities to access easy-to-see features and enter voice commands without the purchase of expensive software such as Zoom Text, or Dragon Naturally Speaking. <br /><br />
To ensure the support system was able to serve the students in as many ways as possible, multi-modal functionality was built into the system.<br /><br />
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens seventh paragraph --> 
<strong>7. Seeking support presents a variety of privacy concerns, especially when students receive specific, personalized feedback.</strong><br /><br />
Legal protections apply to certain information students might seek or share.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal: Structure chat so that important conversations may be directed to appropriate, authorized help, and also, archive important anonymous conversations.<br /><br />
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens eighth paragraph --> 

<strong>8. Students sometimes struggle to connect with professors and advisors to address online learning support needs.</strong><br /><br />
Difficulty in receiving one-on-one assistance may impact the quality of support students receive.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal:<br /><br /> 
The initiatives that addressed the concerns described in items 1, 3, and 4 addressed many of the concerns connecting students to help. The specialized components of this item, item 8, offer a convenient, centralized location for the professor to receive notifications, questions from the students, or signal that he is available for conversation.<br /><br />
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens ninth paragraph --> 
<strong>9. Accessibility for students with disabilities is still a challenge.</strong><br /><br />
Various systems and software packages provide a wide range of support and access to students with disabilities.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal:<br /><br /> 
A student with multiple disabilities was part and parcel to the process of designing and building the portal, and his input was integral in designing the User Interface. Standard accessibility practices were employed, but also, because the student was alongside at all points of the design process, new, one-of-a-kind accessibility initiatives were created — one of which is absolutely unique to USFSP.<br /><br /> 
Additionally, because the search function plays an extremely large role to those with disabilities, a specialized search function was developed to work specifically with USFSP databases, enabling a very targeted, context-sensitive search result. It is a simple but powerful initiative that allows students with disabilities to find information on a timely basis on par with those who do not have disabilities. This allowed us to substantially meet the definition of “accessible” as defined by the Office of Civil Rights and the U.S. Department of Education regarding inaccessible IT.<br /><br />
</div><br />
 <div><!-- opens tenth paragraph --> 
<strong>10.Students need easy access to information we are legally obliged to supply, including Title IX and CLERY documentation.</strong><br /><br />
We must supply easy, direct access to basic information about the University and its support for students.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal: A public-facing page that is searchable by report type.
We also reviewed the design of the Online Student Support Portal in terms of our responsibility to provide resources online where they were otherwise available by coming to campus. We did take especial note one of the recent cases, for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida Juan Carlos Gil, Plaintiff v. Winn Dixie Stores, Inc., Defendant Civil Action No. 16-23020-Civ-Scola, Judge Scola noted that “Winn-Dixie’s website is heavily integrated with, and in many ways operates as a gateway to, Winn-Dixie’s physical store locations.” <br /><br />
