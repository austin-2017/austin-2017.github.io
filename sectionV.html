<strong>1. Students find it confusing and difficult to obtain information.</strong><br /><br />
Information about online learning appears in different places and formats. Students aren’t sure where to look or how to interpret the information they receive.<br /><br />

This concern really encompasses two distinct components; confusion, and difficulty. How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal: <br /><br />
To address difficulty: The portal was designed to bring information to the student, rather than have the student search for information. This was accomplished via custom code, developed in-house, and unique to USFSP.<br /><br /> 
To address confusion: The portal structure was developed to work around centralized repositories, customized to USFSP and populated by authoritative USFSP stakeholders. This content is dynamically generated, meaning, as soon as a stakeholder updates the information, the information is immediately available to students. No middle-man is required.<br /><br />
To address confusion: The portal was designed to bridge the “two kinds” of content silos: Technological, and Organizational. The portal provides a technological path to cross silos, but the technology alone is not enough. Organizational expertise is made available via keywords so that student concerns may be forwarded to an appropriate organizational unit by consulting a keyword list. This enables a bridge across silos not only from a technical standpoint, but an informational one also. It enables a way to find the expertise of other departments. The keywords are maintained by the stakeholders themselves.<br /><br />
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens second paragraph --> 

<strong>2. It’s a challenge to balance student privacy with the transparency needed to promote student safety.</strong><br /><br />
Finding the right balance between protecting and disseminating information is critical.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal:<br /><br /> 
A “Help” drop-down menu available on every public-facing page, with the special note that if there is an emergency, to call 9-1-1.<br /><br /> 
Develop a chat platform that allowed anonymous and private conversation for students, strengthened by a keyword feature, unique to USFSP, that supported staff in the routing of the chat to an appropriate authority. This includes the ability to list and publicize special USF system after-hours support for USFSP students, and the ability to list off-campus support institutions, such as area hospitals. On the recommendation of one of our students with disabilities, geolocation features were incorporated for mobile devices. To address privacy concerns, permission must be enabled before geolocation is enabled.<br /><br />
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens third paragraph --> 
<strong>3. Some students are unprepared for online learning.</strong><br /><br />
Many students approach online learning with misconceptions about the rigor required of the experience.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal:<br /><br /> 
To address connecting students with the people who can help them learn how to handle rigorous requirements: Connect students to librarians, appropriate support staff, and university professors in a more robust and targeted manner, technologically speaking.<br /><br />
To address the problem that students may not be as proficient with digital technology as we may assume: Address the myth of the Digital Native. The myth of the Digital Native assumes that students are able to find help easily on digital platforms, because they have been using them most of their lives. While it is true that students are familiar with these platforms, they are not necessarily familiar with how to search for help using them. Students rely heavily on Google, but they are not very good at customizing searches to get targeted results. The portal takes advantage of an interface that is Google-like in function, to make the student feel comfortable. Under the hood, however, the database is built to deliver targeted resources for students to get to the help they need. This is done first, through a Google-like search, then via chat, or email. From there, authoritative resources can connect with the student, directing him to the appropriate resources, for example, the Student Success Center or the Student Technology Center.<br /><br />
</div><br />
 <div><!-- opens fourth paragraph --> 

<strong>4. Some students are unprepared for college.</strong><br /><br />
The transition from high school to college challenges many incoming students.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal:<br /><br />
In many ways, the features for connecting students to appropriate help in item 3 also had direct applications to addressing the concerns in item 4. There’s a nuance of difference between the concerns in item 3 and in item 4, however, in that item 3, as worded, tends to align with academic concerns, whereas the concerns in item 4 tend to align with concerns young people face when encountering a college environment for the first time.<br /><br />
To address connecting students with the people who can help them fit in with college culture: Connect students to appropriate support staff and community assets in a more robust and targeted manner, technologically speaking. In terms of addressing a young person’s outreach for help, the portal was designed to be able to address questions asked anonymously.<br /><br /> 
To help young students embrace the college culture outside the walls of the classroom: Incorporate community connections, technologically speaking.<br /><br /> 
</div><br />
 <div><!-- opens fifth paragraph --> 
<strong>5. Failure to provide timely, comprehensive support to a growing online student body may interfere with our alignment with SACS requirements.</strong><br /><br />
As the portion of instruction delivered online increases, so does the importance of providing adequate support services.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal:<br /><br />
Create special interfaces to allow stakeholders to tag reports necessary to SACS, and create a special, public-facing page, dynamically populated by the stakeholders themselves. This dynamically-populated page allows auditors to search for reports relevant to SACS and other important institutions.<br /><br />
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens sixth paragraph --> 

<strong>6. Existing support systems serve students to varying degrees, depending on the device from which they are accessed and the student’s needs.</strong><br /><br />
Some information is difficult to access on mobile devices or without the use of downloadable plugins. Some students require access to specialized software, depending on their major.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal:<br /><br />
To address the difficulty of accessing the content on mobile devices, the platform was developed as a mobile-first one. If a web site is available on mobile platforms, it will be available anywhere.<br /><br />
To address the issue of downloadable software/plugins: An Accessibility Initiative baked into the portal was designed by Dr. Casey Frechette in concert with USFSP student Robert Beasey. This special feature, unique to USFSP, allows students with certain disabilities to access easy-to-see features and enter voice commands without the purchase of expensive software such as Zoom Text, or Dragon Naturally Speaking. <br /><br />
To ensure the support system was able to serve the students in as many ways as possible, multi-modal functionality was built into the system.<br /><br />
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens seventh paragraph --> 
<strong>7. Seeking support presents a variety of privacy concerns, especially when students receive specific, personalized feedback.</strong><br /><br />
Legal protections apply to certain information students might seek or share.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal: Structure chat so that important conversations may be directed to appropriate, authorized help, and also, archive important anonymous conversations.<br /><br />
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens eighth paragraph --> 

<strong>8. Students sometimes struggle to connect with professors and advisors to address online learning support needs.</strong><br /><br />
Difficulty in receiving one-on-one assistance may impact the quality of support students receive.<br /><br />
How this was addressed in the Online Student Support Portal:<br /><br /> 
The initiatives that addressed the concerns described in items 1, 3, and 4 addressed many of the concerns connecting students to help. The specialized components of this item, item 8, offer a convenient, centralized location for the professor to receive notifications, questions from the students, or signal that he is available for conversation.<br /><br />
</div><br />
 <div><!-- opens ninth paragraph --> 
One facet of context is the ability to ask both general and specific questions, a capability built into the Online Student Support Portal. A general search box on the homepage connects students with answers on myriad topics. A specific search box on the “Courses” page provides results from OASIS, our online course schedule, along with special filters to customize how results are returned. Unlike the official course search page, our customized tool provides a streamlined interface that mimics the Google search experience. In other words, students can search in a way that makes intuitive sense, without needing to understand codes, catalog numbers, hierarchies, abbreviations, and other conventions internal to our systems and processes.
</div><br />
 <div><!-- opens tenth paragraph --> 
The platform was designed to be fully integrated, rather than have functionality bolted-on from third-party sources. As is true for components in the physical world, it is also true for the virtual world, where dis-similar components join, there is weakness at the joint. Relying on third-party vendors adds maintenance requirements for complicated systems; if a change is made in the vendor’s product, then everything else may be affected. Both the quality of the technology and its attendant service is uneven, and sometimes, unpredictable, with third party sources.
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens eleventh paragraph --> 
Consequently, to keep maintenance down, the platform was built as a self-integrated unit able to stand on its own. That said, this platform was designed to  integrate with the extant, or upcoming, important assets already in place at USFSP. It was extremely important to us to keep these assets in place and to connect to them — not to replace them. Student retention, a problem for all universities and colleges, was on our minds as we worked. Because the platform was developed in-house, the expertise of the platform builders aligns with students and their needs. We’re here, we live, teach, and work with the students — here, at USFSP. The platform has USFSP built into its DNA.
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens twelth paragraph --> 
It’s important to understand that although we were tasked with providing ready access to information that “supported” online learning, we were to stop at the line that actually included online instruction. In effect, the portal would serve as a gateway to student services online. As we worked, we kept in mind the definition of “accessible” as defined by the Office of Civil Rights and the U.S. Department of Education regarding inaccessible IT — that a student with disabilities must be able to access the same information ‘’... with substantially equivalent ease of use.’’ (Note 1). Any websites and/or applications we developed had to provide information with “substantially equivalent ease of use” was a significant task. In other words, it was not enough to provide a comprehensive “website” linking to the online courses, it had to be “substantially” as easy for a person with disabilities to use as for a person without disabilities. We could not fall back on the fact that services were offered on-campus for those with disabilities. Consider the recent case of Gil v. Winn Dixie; Winn Dixie argued that only physical locations are subject to Title III of the ADA — and lost the case. The lesson as it applies to us is that, simply because student resources are available on campus, the institution still has the responsibility to make resources accessible online. 
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens thirteenth paragraph --> 
The challenge was magnified by the sheer volume and diversity of the content we needed to connect: orientation, registration, advising, research and study, are examples of content and contact points we were to specifically address. Data was in silos, and we had to find a way to “flatten” it. In one trial run, we found one student with disabilities took close to thirty minutes just to access the link on OASIS simply to access the courses for his major within the upcoming semester. We felt we could do better than that for our students with disabilities. When we showed the solution to the student with disabilities, his comment was, “This is not only going to be great for students with disabilities, this is going to be great for ALL students.”
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens fourteenth paragraph --> 
The reason this works for all students, and not just those with disabilities, is the fact that we do not expect students to be experts on organizational hierarchy to find the information they need. We don’t make them find the information, we bring the information to them. This is the critical, one-of-a-kind, development that we have made for our students here at USFSP. 
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens fifteenth paragraph --> 
The portal was designed to align interaction with student expectations; the portal embraces a “Google” sensibility to the searches, because that is what students are comfortable using. It also embraces voice input, again, because so many students use their smartphones for performing tasks. 
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens sixteenth paragraph --> 
First and last, however, the portal interface was designed to help students ask questions, and with every design stroke, to enforce the idea that we were here to listen. This is critical. Students seek help by asking questions, so the portal enables students to ask questions very easily, and at all points within it. There’s not a special “help” page. The whole portal IS a help platform. Research supports this. “The fact that explicit questions are associated with direct support seeking suggests that most of the time when people asked for direct help, they framed it in form of a question, which is not surprising.” (Andalibi et al, 2016). So, the portal interface makes it very clear that we want students — or their support network of friends and family — to feel free to ask questions. And, it starts with the landing page. Anyone can just ask.
</div><br />

</div><!-- wrapper for image -->
			       
<div><!-- opens seventeenth paragraph --> 
The very first thing a student sees when signing on to the portal is a large, “Google-Like” search box, in which he can ask anything. In this prototype version, the artificial intelligence, developed in-house here at USFSP, understands that this is a “general” question due to the context (location) of the page. There are very few tasks for the user on this page. Very few decisions have to be made at this point, and, therefore, there is very little confusion as to what is expected of the user. Modern smartphone users will be familiar with the mode of just, “asking” for what they want. However, there’s a bit of a safety net here that’s not present on most phones. If, for some reason, the student does not want to “ask” a question, “traditional” methods are available to him. The navigation bar above allows him to start a chat, or look for information on courses in particular, or generally through an information menu. The platform takes advantage of the best of both worlds, the modern convenience of mobile technology, combined with the comprehensive nature typically associated with desktop operations, and combines them into one platform.
</div><br />
<div><!-- opens eightteenth paragraph --> 
In the above scenario, an automatic answer is provided by artificial intelligence (AI), coded in-house by USFSP’s Dr. Frechette. The code was developed so that the “answers” are informed by the stakeholders themselves. If a stakeholder changes the hours of operation for the department, the information immediately becomes available to the AI.
