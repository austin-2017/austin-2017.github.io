  The USFSP Online Student Support Portal Team, consisting of Dr. Casey Frechette, Mr. Berrie Watson, and Ms. Sharon Austin, were tasked with designing a robust web presence that would allow USFSP’s online students to accomplish all aspects of their academic careers without needing to come to campus. 
 This included components from such significant entities as Orientation, Registration, Advising, Research and Study, among others. 
  Everything up to, but not including, instruction was tasked; 
  this remained under the purview of the faculty and Online Learning and Instructional Technology.

The amount of information was massive, and the needs of the stakeholders were incredibly diverse. 
There was a need to find a way to offer the information comprehensively, with authorship by the stakeholders themselves. 
Traditionally, this was done by providing a comprehensive set of links, and the first design efforts reflected this traditional approach. 
After some initial testing, it was obvious that there was more to the problem than first met the eye. 
Students had to understand the jargon and organizational hierarchy in order to find the information they needed, and normally, they did not know either of these things when they looked for help.
Put simply, traditional web resources were not “student centric”, they were instead, “authority-centric”. 
So much time and effort is spent educating the student on “how” to find the proper authority for the proper help, that frustration is understandable. 
To address this, a custom platform using a custom process was developed in-house to address student questions, and to provide a means to archive the questions should a staff member not be around immediately to answer them. Additionally, all questions would be reviewed, not only to check for possible threats to student safety, but to continuously improve the artificial intelligence developed in-house by Dr. Frechette, as well as, to generate targeted FAQs based upon the students’ own questions. 
It also had to be mobile-friendly, and accessible to our students with disabilities.

The technological component was only half of the equation that went into the development of the Online Student Support Portal. 
The other half was the commitment to the student support network, to include friends, family, and community. 
The portal takes into account those who support our students, but who may not be part of the “formal” USFSP network, such as family and friends. 
So, the technology was built to accommodate this informal network of support for the students.
