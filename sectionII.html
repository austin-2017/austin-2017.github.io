 <div><!-- opens first paragraph in introduction -->   
The USFSP Online Student Support Portal team, consisting of Dr. Casey Frechette, Mr. Berrie Watson, and Ms. Sharon Austin, was tasked with designing a robust web presence that would help USFSP’s online students to accomplish tasks to advance their academic careers without coming to campus. Needs related to orientation, registration, advising, research and study, and other were considered. 
The portal was intended to cover all aspects of the online student’s college experience outside of the virtual classroom.   
 </div><br /><!-- closes first paragraph in introduction -->
		   
 <div><!-- opens seciond paragraph in introduction -->        
Accounting for all campus departments and units relevant to these tasks resulted in a massive amount of information and diverse set of stakeholder needs.
 </div><br /><!-- closes second paragraph in introduction -->
		   
<div><!-- opens third paragraph in introduction --> 
A traditional approach to such a task might involve compiling a comprehensive set of links, and the first design efforts reflected this strategy.
</div><!-- closes third paragraph in introduction --> 
		   
 <div><!-- opens fourth paragraph in introduction -->  		   
Initial testing revealed limitations with this approach. 
Merely aggregating existing resources meant students would need to understand the organizational hierarchy, decode jargon and recognize inconsistencies in how information was conveyed — some small and some large. 
To address this, we developed custom platform to address student questions both synchronously and asynchronously,  and archive answers. 
The platform used interactions between students and support staff to improve an artificial intelligence system developed to provide instantaneous response and generate targeted FAQs that could be browsed or searched.
</div><br /><!-- closes fourth paragraph in introduction --> 
		   
<div><!-- opens fifth paragraph in introduction -->  
Developing a mobile-friendly, accessible platform for our students with disabilities was another integral goal.		   
</div><br /><!-- closes fifth paragraph in introduction --> 		   

<div><!-- opens sixth paragraph in introduction -->  
The technological component was only half of the equation that went into the development of the Online Student Support Portal. 
The other half was the commitment to the student support network, to include friends, family, and community. 
The portal takes into account those who support our students, but who may not be part of the “formal” USFSP network, such as family and friends. 
So, the technology was built to accommodate this informal network of support for the students.		   
</div><br /><!-- closes sixth paragraph in introduction --> 
		   

<div><!-- opens seventh paragraph in introduction -->  
The functionality of the platform developed to addresses these challenges is in place. 
Launching the portal, however, requires coordination with administrators and significant user testing. 
We are convinced that the platform we have developed is unique among institutions of higher education. 
All features interact with one another, and therein lies the platform’s power. 
It was built from the ground up, right here at USFSP, with a focus on student success.
