The USFSP Online Student Support Portal team, consisting of Dr. Casey Frechette, Mr. Berrie Watson, and Ms. Sharon Austin, was tasked with designing a robust web presence that would help USFSP’s online students to accomplish tasks to advance their academic careers without coming to campus. Needs related to orientation, registration, advising, research and study, and other were considered. 
The portal was intended to cover all aspects of the online student’s college experience outside of the virtual classroom.

Accounting for all campus departments and units relevant to these tasks resulted in a massive amount of information and diverse set of stakeholder needs.

The technological component was only half of the equation that went into the development of the Online Student Support Portal. 
The other half was the commitment to the student support network, to include friends, family, and community. 
The portal takes into account those who support our students, but who may not be part of the “formal” USFSP network, such as family and friends. 
So, the technology was built to accommodate this informal network of support for the students.

<div><!-- opens fourth paragraph in introduction -->  
Here is the platform developed to addresses these challenges.
At this time, the functionality of the platform is in place, but it needs coordination with administrators, and significant user testing.
We are convinced that no other school has anything even remotely like this, because it is a highly integrated platform. 
The features are not piecemeal implementations; all features interact with one another, and therein lies its power. 
It was built from the ground up, right here at USFSP. 
The focus was and is about student success, and for that, we believe that this one-of-a-kind platform really and truly can significantly improve student success through the support that this platform enables.
