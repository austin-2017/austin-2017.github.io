## Empowering Students With Disabilities
## A presentation to EDUCAUSE Conference 2017.   How students with disabilities are empowered through an interface based on work by Dr. Casey Frechette, Mr. Berrie Watson, Robert Beasey, and Ms. Sharon Austin.  Although one of the goals of the portal was to ensure the portal met accessibility standards, we found that many initiatives developed for usability offered significant, unexpected benefits to students with disabilities.
